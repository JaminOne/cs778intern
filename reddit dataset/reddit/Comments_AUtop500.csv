Keep in mind that all medical tests are fallible. They can report that you have the disease when you don't, and that you don't when you do. At this time we don't have a good estimate of the failure rate of these tests, except that they're probably small.

"At the start of the infection the virus is mostly in nose and throat, which makes it easily detectable by a swab. But when it moved into the lungs a simple swab may not be enough to detect the virus still stuck to your lung tissue. You actually would have to cough up some of the mucus in your lung to reliable test for any remaining virus. So it‚Äôs possible to have a false negative test, because the swab may not have picked up enough of the virus to detect later in the infection.  And apparently you can have plenty of the virus in your lungs even if you‚Äôre largely asymptomatic. I guess that‚Äôs why you need more than one negative test to be cleared. 

Source: excellent German (sorry) daily podcast from a German virologist (https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/21-Coronavirus-Update-Antikoerpertests-kommen-bald,podcastcoronavirus156.html#pcr). Here‚Äôs a (Google + corrections) translation of the relevant passage:


>>With this disease, in the first week of the symptoms, samples from the throat, i.e. swabs, are actually very reliably positive in the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests.  And then, in the second week, they‚Äôre no longer completely positive.  The patient still has symptoms, but it may be that a throat swab can no longer prove it.  This isn‚Äôt because the test is not good, it is simply because the virus is then no longer present in the throat, but in the lungs.  We now know that even with patients who have very mild courses of the disease, i.e. who are largely asymptomatic, there is still a lot of virus in the lungs.  And that remains there for about two weeks, or even three weeks, in the uncomplicated cases.  And that‚Äôs how long we can safely detect the virus from the lungs with PCR.  However, many patients cannot cough up a sample from the lungs so that the throat swabs are actually the most common sample.",5.0,2020-04-19 21:53:15,3.0

"In many ways testing is a measure in the patterns of human activity. Death toll is a better measure of virus activity. The problem is the 17.3 day (on average) time between infection and death. So the best you can probably do is decide on what mortality rate you want to use on your model. For example of you said 0.5% then 18 deaths = 3600 cases 17 days ago. Then use whatever doubling rate you think is right to estimate infection count today. For example double every 4 days would be over 60,000 infections in Australia today. Of course you have to decide what the doubling rate you are comfortable with to fairly reflect the impact of interventions around isolation, cancelled events, etc. There are a lot of assumptions you have to make which is why it's hard to do good modelling",10.0,2020-03-30 07:41:30,4.0

"Its also worth noting that every other country's testing is just as lacking as ours if not more, so in seeing some people extrapolating our death rate or other factors into a 60,000 or some other total true case number you can't compare that to a place that has 60,000 reported cases. If the assumption is that we have a heap of untested and unreported cases here than that is true of everywhere else. Chances are that in other countries they also have 20x or 50x true cases compared to their reported numbers. So relative to how bad things are elsewhere it's much better here. Yes the safe estimate is to treat our outbreak as if its 10-50x worse than the numbers, but that means that we're still much better placed than most other countries. I do believe that we'll see a big spike in cases over the next two weeks still from unchecked community spread but its sort of beyond the point. We can't and won't test everyone with symptoms and that's fine, it won't give us much extra information. We're treating everyone as infected for now and see where it all lands in a few weeks then start nailing down our infection and spread mapping to minimise new infections. It'll be a process. The main thing is to not let up too early and there's no indication that that's the plan.",4.0,2020-03-30 20:31:09,4.0
"One caveat to this whole post is the idea that on days where the test numbers are higher, more contact tracing tests may have been done; people with a slight risk, but a much higher likelihood of returning negative than other people being tested. (For example, testing everyone that attended a particular wedding after one guest tested positive will boost the number of tests, and if the majority of those people test negative, that lowers the daily percentage of positive cases) On days where test numbers are low, most likely only people that are at a high risk were tested, rising the percentage of positive tests.

"That makes sense. Days where there are a high number of tests might just be due to increased contact tracing. Testing lots of people that are at slight risk but are probably negative. On days where there are less tests they‚Äôre probably only testing people that are at high risk because they‚Äôre presenting with symptoms.

Meaning that, the percentage of positive tests each day is actually fairly arbitrary because we aren‚Äôt testing a random sample. So... there‚Äôs no way to get an accurate statistical picture of what‚Äôs going on üò∞",1.0,2020-03-30 10:50:13,4.0

"I guess to see how close you were, all you have to do is see how it plays out over the next couple of weeks.   
The other thing worth mentioning, I assume the virus's R^0 of between 2 and 3 (I've seen different estimates) is with no interventions. The aim of government interventions is to drive the R^0 down. As it approaches 1, the doubling rate slows dramatically.  
If we count backwards 17 days from today, you had 2814-2229=585 new infections on that day. Assuming death rate of 0.5% (with functioning healthcare) we would have expected to see 3 deaths in 24 hours, which is bang on.

"Shouldn‚Äôt double every 6 days for that long, given that it‚Äôs basically a closed system now.

Median time to symptom development is 5.8 days, call it 6 days.

So if it‚Äôs doubling every 6 days, each infected person is infecting just one new person.

So you‚Äôre balancing right on top of the curve.  That‚Äôs unlikely.     Doubling every 5 days (heading up the curve) or doubling every 7 days (heading down the curve) are more likely.

You need to model a sigmoid curve, not an exponential one.

In other words, if it‚Äôs 6 days between generations, and doubling time is over 6 days, effective R must be less than 1, which is great, it‚Äôs dying down.

(Of course you‚Äôre still have variance in testing rates and delays in results to account for.)",4.0,2020-03-30 14:10:43,4.0

"I also just got tested today in Brisbane. I have very mild but definite symptoms. I was reluctant to ""waste"" a kit, but symptoms set in 4-5 days after my flight home so it's possible I was exposed on my flight home, or by someone at the Philippines office. Frankly after a week of self-isolation it would be nice just to be sure I have it so my partner knows she'll soon have it too, and we can both get out of the house and move forward with our lives once we're both confirmed recovered.

Called my local GP and got a phone consultation this morning. They went over my travel, timelines, symptoms etc and they gave me a referral to get tested (which was sent straight to the pathology lab). $55 fee for the consult. 

Tried calling ahead to confirm they weren't too busy but no one ever picked up the phone. After half a dozen tries over a couple hours, I decided to just go and see if I could get it done before Friday night rush hour traffic started. Note only SPECIFIC clinics have been designated fever clinics. I went to the wrong lab the first time as there were several pathology labs with the same name within a couple of km of each other. Make sure you take note of the address and go to the right one. 

After reading stories on reddit and elsewhere I wasn't sure what to expect. Walked in and the place was empty, no other patients waiting in line. Turns out that lab is only staffed by a single person and they won't answer the phone if they're with a patient. Moments after I walked in, the previous patient walked out and I got straight into the testing room. 

The nurse went over all my symptoms and recorded the answers again, presumably to be submitted with the test. First test was a nasal swab where she stuck an extra long q-tip into the back of my nostrils, one for each nostril. Felt a bit like getting dumped in wave and having water go into my nose; mildly unpleasant. Second was two separate throat swabs which didn't hurt at all, one for coronavirus and one to test for other viruses.

That was it. Exited the testing room and there was no one else waiting. 

I was told to expect results within 24-48 hours. Not sure if I'll get a call from my doctor, a text or some third party. If it's the doctor, I may not know until Monday. Self-isolation continues...

Note - if you don't have medicare or have let your medicare card expire like I did, get that sorted or the pathology will cost you about $220. It took 5 minutes on the phone to fix mine up. I didn't update my postal address many years ago so never received the new card. They gave me a new valid card number on the spot and the new card will be here in a couple weeks.

For everyone who is writing in to say that they didn‚Äôt want to waste a test ‚Äì or that they are young, please please please can at least contact the hotline. This outbreak is being spread not from people who are sick but from people who have minimal symptoms but her infectious and I spreading it around to vulnerable people. Even if you feel well alright or a symptomatic or don‚Äôt have very severe symptoms you should still be under quarantine if you I found to have the virus. The only way to beat this is by testing people who may have been in contact and who may be carrying this virus. The purpose of the screening questionnaire in the hotline is to sort out who would be at the highest risk and I would strongly suggest everyone to go through the hotline rather than deciding for themselves if they think they might have the disease. The hotline will screen out who needs to go to a fever clinic and he will need to be tested.

"Very well said, mate!
I work in retail as well and had been to the CBD to visit my friends today and most retail staffs I've come across were confused why we are still opening after Monday.
One of the reason why a country doesn't take such virus seriously is most likely due to how it's government educate its people about it. We've been told many confusing messages from end of Jan, so some people started realising this is serious, while some others couldn't care less because the PM had convinced them we are under control, and no masks needed, life as usual.
As confusing as our PM has been, keeping retail sector opened is another brilliant idea he decided , where he encourages people to go and shop and keep these businesses running, while also urging them to stay home .",3.0,2020-03-23 15:21:12,7.0

"\- Cry-wolf syndrome of the media. In the absence of real drama media catastrophizes everything. This makes people complacent. Ma and Pa Bogan think this is just another media beat-up.

\- bad shit happens elsewhere, but Australia always dodges that bullet. That's their heuristic. People can't accept bad shit is happening there.

\- Some people can only understand things in reference to past experience. In a novel situation they have no reference point and so can't understand it.

\- The relationship between personal and societal risk is asymmetrical. People don't understand that the measures are not to protect you from getting the virus, they are to stop the people with the virus from giving it to people who don't have it. In early stages of spreading, the risk that you will get the virus is low, but the risk that SOMEONE SOMEWHERE is super-spreading it is very high. This is an important nuance. The authorities don't know who the spreaders are, so we have to assume it's you.

\- People need to see signs as that it's real before they believe it's real. The body-count in Australia will be real, but that will be a pointer to what they needed to do a month ago. No time machines unfortunately.

\- The virus has a brilliant evolutionary adaption from the virus's point of view because it doesn't cripple all its hosts so it enjoys great mobility. The benignly infected are starting grass-fires everywhere. If it made people more sick it would be less mobile.

\- The government messaging has been vague, ambiguous and even undermining itself. If you tell people it's ok for kids to be at school then they think it's all a storm in a teacup. I don't want to get too political but there's few times in Australia's history that something with such high stakes has been so badly bungled from a comms perspective. Scomo will probably have the record for the next 200 years of Australia's deadliest PM as a consequence of careless incompetence. Only starting a nuclear war could top it at this point.

\- The government has tried to optimise for economic outcomes and health outcomes at the same time, and arguably fucked both worse. From a health perspective they were softening the message when a strengthening of the message was required.  The ambiguous messaging meant businesses were ramping up into new projects that were going to be severely disrupted, instead of tying up loose ends)

\- The media has focussed on scuffles over toilet paper at critical milestones in our journey into the virus. That sends the message that the biggest problem is toilet paper shortage, when the reality was that immediate behavioural changes are required to avoid deaths of tens of thousands of people. People trust the media that they wouldn't be focused on toilet paper and hand sanitizer stories if we were staring down an existential threat.

\- Anxiety management - people tell themselves comforting stories to manage their own anxiety. There is a saying that the worse lies we tell are the ones we tell ourselves.

Examples of anxiety-reducing lies this week include:

(1) we won't suffer like italy because they have a very aged population

(2)  the virus is just killing people who were almost dead anyway

(3) our health systems are better equipped

(4) we don't have the population density (I'm hearing this one everywhere from people that work in a cubicle farm! As if Australia's vast tracts of barely habited space will insulate them from the person 2 feet away)

"**COVID-19 testing**

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for clinical purposes and population surveillance. 

Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population. This variability also affects reported case-fatality rates.

"First - can we accept that a lot of people will need to cut their hair in the next six months and they have no idea how to do it themselves?

A decent strategy would involve something like:

\- keeping the number of people in the hairdressing salon low (See the 4m2 per person rule)

\- keeping the time spent in the hairdresser low (see the 30 min rule)

\- keeping sick people out of society (see the 'stay home if you're sick' rule)

We are not going to stop every infection. That is not the governments goal. They are looking to slow it down. They have stated that many times. If we all followed the guidelines, we'd slow it down significantly.

The lack of transparency in disclosing how many community cases there are in each city is disturbing. I still am fairly certain that the government would be quite happy for a certain percentage of us to be infected so as to avoid the elimination business that New Zealanders going for.


What I want to know is when I wake up each morning, how many cases they were from the community, where they were and how concerned I should be about widespread community transmission. There is also obviously a problem with clusters in health facilities but they seem to be reported weeks after the event.

"I've started following this pandemic since late January because I have so many colleagues that come from different backgrounds ,and we interact with many tourists from all over the world. 

At first I was concerned, but as I gained more medical facts about this virus, instead of all those speculations, propaganda theories, misleading media reports etc, I calmed down alot because by then I realised if we know more about this virus, we can then set the right attitude towards how we can contribute to the prevention of this virus. And we will then know how we should be treating people around us who may or may not carry the virus unknowingly-with lots of respect, more understandings than ever, stay a friendly social distance but stay connected. 

What is happening now in Australia frustrates me, because we had the benefit of summer temperature the last two months, we had the opportunities to watch it unfold in China, Japan, Korea, Iran, Italy, then just last week the US and UK. Yet we are still as unprepared as China was. What's worse, is not only is our government not prepared, it's also not providing us with sufficient informations for us to prepare ourselves, which will buy time for the government to source medical supplies , or delay economical impact. All of a suddenly we were told to get nervous and don't go out, when some people didn't even know much about the existence of COVID-19.

I hope that you still have hopes that this will eventually get passed, have faith in our medical experts and their efforts , have faith in people around you that you can get through difficulties together. Our politicians may be just doing their job playing politics, but we as a member of this planet we share have to remain hopeful that we can do better together :)

At this stage no, although I do recognise that parents have a right to choose and each family's circumstances are different.

From the perspective of you and your child's health, there is no evidence that children can spread the infection widely ‚Äî I'm not aware of any large outbreaks linked to transmission in a school setting.

This is in contrast to the many outbreaks linked to gatherings of adults such as churches, conventions, nursing homes and large family occasions.

To date, teachers who have acquired infection in Australia are thought to have acquired infection¬†during¬†overseas travel¬†or from colleagues, rather than from students.",2.0,2020-03-21 04:40:25,19.0

"I went down the rabbit hole on this as if it is right, why are most countries doing the opposite? It is not sitting right

I wrote to Dr Cheng yesterday to ascertain if this was still the current thinking or outdated information. I was motivated to do this when a colleague told me kids aren't spreaders, in reference to this story.

He said it was still the thinking and referred me to this:  [https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020](https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020)

The blurb about WHO-China joint mission noting that adults infected children but not the other way around was jarring in context of everything else I knew. If this is thought to be true, it should be widely known/common knowledge as it's extremely important, yet I'd not come across it. so I tracked down that report that was cited.

[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

Which says ""  From available data, and in the absence of results from serologic studies, **it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations).  ""**

However then went on to say "" Of note, people interviewed by the Joint Mission Team could not recall episodes in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult. ""

So the reality is more like, ""insufficient data cannot say, but interesting to note..."" I would hardly want to justify something so high stakes on what is almost an afterthought, mentioned as it perhaps warrants further investigation, when that research had already explicity said ""it was not possible to determine....""Moreover, we have a lot more data now than just Wuhan, so why hinge it exclusively on that?

Finally, the government keeps mentioning countries that have had success without closing schools. (Singapore) Those countries have done this in conjunction with things that Australia hasn't done (eg temperature checks required to get in the door, followed by aggressive testing and tracing. Not making light of it, there's a lot to weigh up with social and economic impacts but there's an argument to be mounted that if you are not going to close schools, ok fine, but you need to be doing a lot of other things (high testing/aggressive contact tracing) to drive R0 down - see:    [https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56) )

see table at the bottom which illustrates the kind of measures that might be required to stave of exponential growth.

People are saying we need to see the govt model that shows that the measures in place without school closing are sufficient to drive down the R0. I don't know why they are not sharing it. Something doesn't smell right, it's hard to feel assured they know what they are doing when it's all top secret and we can't make our own judgement.

Teachers may feel more able to manage hygiene practices at school with a smaller staff-student ratio.

Many of the experts agree. If you can & want to take your kids out of school; go ahead.

"This is true, this is about to get really hard for a lot of people. However our economy was already heading this way, the coronavirus just sped it up.

I understand that people in necessary areas feel like this. The difference is that these areas have had system put in place to avoid the infection. My father is in food production and they have the place being disinfected every 15 minutes, they all have PPE gear, enforcing the 1.5 rule with an iron hand and are testing people at work. This is also happening on transport

I can tell you now, that despite what the government is telling you, that is NOT happening in schools. In schools it is business as usual.

Schools are not being provided with any of these measures. Teachers are struggling to provide there own hand sanitizer and glen 20 and yes handsoap, there are no extra cleaning services, are in overcrowded classrooms and are having to deal with sick kids as parents are STILL sending kids to school sick. In fact, I know that at my school, the front office staff are being abused daily by parents refusing to take their sick kids back home.  

Where is the duty of care? When all these kids get sick they will do what they always do and blame the teachers. The 1.5 m rule is impossible to implement in schools and if there isn't enough stress from that, teachers already massive work load has increased 10 told due to having both physical and online classes. We don't know when schools will close, that makes it very hard to prepare online classes as we do know where to start them, you also have the ethical issues of kids not having access to Internet at home because our government still views have internet access as a luxury and not utility.

"Hey Alfonso.

I'm in the same boat as you.

My partner and I arrived in Melbourne mid February after living in UK, holidaying in South America (where I'm from) and Italy (where he's from). We went to Thailand and the 12th of Feb we had a one way ticket here. Visas and the $ they ask for, in. He managed to find a job - I had a harder time but managed to find a beautiful restaurant next to the sea, with wonderful people and lovely customers. I did two shifts there and they let go of half the staff because all their customers that had booked events started cancelling due to fear. The next weekend, they set out the order to close all bars and restaurants, hence my other half is with me at home now.

It's difficult! We saw tickets to our countries (already thinking about the fact that we'd have to separate, we're engaged [wedding is already postponed], not nice) but they were over 2k aud. Not to mention most of them are being cancelled. I can't enter Italy with him (specially flights with that destination are being cancelled, imagine) and he can't enter Chile with me. We have no ""home"" to go back to. No job in the UK (we could be receiving the 80% salary if we were still there). Nowhere to go. No help from embassies. Just a little bit of cash (money goes like water) to get us through a couple of months.

We both applied to Coles job. 35000 ppl applied for 5000 jobs. We both sat down hours to find a farm that would take us - nothing. They're either not hiring for the moment (covid) or not hiring at all. We applied for call centres. We went to our embassies. We called our families. No help and (not much) hope left.

We even tried farms near Brisbane, I have a friend there who could drive us to any farms nearby. No luck. No money to get there and no money for a car (even if we got something in vic) 

But we'll pull through although it feels like lots of dead ends. It's quite difficult. 

If you need a friend to talk to, pm me. Podemos hablar en espa√±ol and support eachother. We'll be fine! Just gotta believe it :) 

Sincerely,
Another backpacker with (too) many dreams

They don't have unlimited tests - wasting them on portions of the population who aren't in any way at risk would be totally irresponsible. What makes you think you need tests where you live?

I don't know your state and the rules change day-to-day to evolve with the spread, but the testing seems pretty reasonable - you get tested if you have come into contact with a confirmed case and exhibit symptoms.

Also your assumptions are just that, stupid assumptions: rural areas have risk - ALL the farms here use tourists for their picking/field work. These tourists, backpackers, from all over the world, are a HOT BED of infection (and not just covid lol) - So yeah, spreading the infection amongst these populations has a very high probability dickhead, and for many other reasons.

The *data* is simply not in yet. Nobody knows beyond guessing what the community spread looks like. So these pretty maps are just that, pretty bullshit.

I know at least 4x people up here around Bundaberg that have had Covid, all recovered, but that was spread from one family who had a member return from a cruise ship. Of those alone, there was more than enough chance to have spread it further if you multiply out the interactions they had during that period, it's insane.

"Yes, this is a bug. The map is programmed such that each postcode is allocated to a suburb, and then each suburb is plotted on the map with the number of cases therein. The issue is that there are two suburbs called Summer Hill, one in the postcode 2421 and one in 2130. 

The post code 2130 also has 3 confirmed cases, but since the map is assigning cases by suburb, these 3 cases have been incorrectly assigned to the summer hill in 2421 (as well as correctly assigned to the summerhill in 2130).

>People who don't need tests don't get tests. That doesn't mean the testing is incomplete or completely unreliably limited - it means people who need it get it.

What are you talking about?  you can only know they didn't need the test after the fact - of course more testing is needed. duh.

>Yes, because ***you don't need them***.

Bullshit. My friend's wife's mother (follow close now, moron) came off a cruise ship, got tested, and was positive for covid-19, had mild symptoms and did isolation. Her daughter then had it. Her daughters husband (my friend) then got all the symptoms, but was refused testing (as too many steps away from the original traveller? who knows)- - - anyway, if someone THAT CLOSE to it was denied, even with symptoms, then how much can you trust the numbers dickhead ? it's obviously going under reported.

Soo, as i said, the stats are bullshit as there is not enough testing to know the true extent of infection, and has nothing to do with me ""not needing it"".

Ah yes, people are getting sick in many areas from the same virus with the common factor being human transmission. The virus is also very similar to the flu and SARs, which are human to human transmitted.
Nah, can't be transmitted by human to human contact.

"I'm reposting my own comment but I looked into this last week when I realised everyone else in the world is saying kids are a powerful vehicle for retransmission, the opposite of what our politically compromised CMO is saying. 

\-----

&#x200B;

I went down the rabbit hole on this as if it is right, why are most countries doing the opposite? It is not sitting right

I  wrote to Dr Cheng yesterday to ascertain if this was still the current  thinking or outdated information. I was motivated to do this when a  colleague told me kids aren't spreaders, in reference to this story.

He said it was still the thinking and referred me to this:  [https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020](https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020)

The  blurb about WHO-China joint mission noting that adults infected  children but not the other way around was jarring in context of  everything else I knew. If this is thought to be true, it should be  widely known/common knowledge as it's extremely important, yet I'd not  come across it. so I tracked down that report that was cited.

[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

Which says ""  From available data, and in the absence of results from serologic studies, **it  is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children,  what role children play in transmission, whether children are less  susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally  milder presentations).  ""**

However  then went on to say "" Of note, people interviewed by the Joint Mission  Team could not recall episodes in which transmission occurred from a  child to an adult. ""

So the  reality is more like, ""insufficient data cannot say, but interesting to  note..."" I would hardly want to justify something so high stakes on what  is almost an afterthought, mentioned as it perhaps warrants further  investigation, when that research had already explicity said ""it was not  possible to determine....""Moreover, we have a lot more data now than  just Wuhan, so why hinge it exclusively on that? 

Finally,  the government keeps mentioning countries that have had success without  closing schools. (Singapore) Those countries have done this in  conjunction with things that Australia hasn't done (eg temperature  checks required to get in the door, followed by aggressive testing and  tracing. Not making light of it, there's a lot to weigh up with social  and economic impacts but there's an argument to be mounted that if you  are not going to close schools, ok fine, but you need to be doing a lot  of other things (high testing/aggressive contact tracing) to drive R0  down - see:    [https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56) )

see table at the bottom which illustrates the kind of measures that might be required to stave of exponential growth.

The social distancing has always been pretty bad and there have always been people enjoying their takeaway food on the grass, or just sitting with their dog or whatever. Things that are against the rules, but probably harmless if they are on their own.

He's just keen to get businesses reopening. This could be good for jobs in the short term, but if it goes wrong then you could end up with even more spread of the virus and then what will happen? Will we have to bring the restrictions in again? What's the point? Let's just not be hasty.

Relaxing restrictions when we still know so little about the virus and whether or not people can actually get significant natural immunity after infection seems foolish.

"The requirements for testing are changing almost daily, we have a screening script we ask everyone but there are cases that don't quite fit the criteria but we feel the need to swab anyway, so we do. We have an isolated room set up with all the PPE and instructions on use and limit to one visitor and monitor their entry and exit. It's a lengthy process for each time we enter a room for observations or meds or even getting imaging done.

We only have two isolation rooms in our ED, so if more than that come in at once it's tricky.

We don't have a lab on-site, our nearest official testing lab is about 45 mins away, we have regular couriers who collect in special bags.

If they are elderly and acutely unwell we have to find a bed to admit them to on the ward, otherwise they can go home for isolation with daily calls. Takes a few days to get the results, you'll probably hear sooner if it's positive.

I know ED staff can generally be a bit rock and roll about precautions, but in this case everyone I've seen has been very strict, from paramedics, to ED staff, to clearing out the X-ray department. The patients are also given masks and we have regular almost daily checks from our education staff that we are comfortable with the correct process for putting on and taking off PPE and what we can use.

Fortunately we don't have to get permission anymore to do the swab, or at least we are just using our clinical judgment. Just because someone doesn't meet the overseas requirements exactly, if they have a fever and respiratory symptoms and we feel they are a risk they get swabbed.

I think this is one of the reasons our confirmed cases are increasing so rapidly, we are testing more people now.

Most people do fine at home, and a lot of the cases turn out to be basic flu or pneumonia, so the patient can be very unwell but not test positive for COVID. 

It's when they have other issues, pre existing heart, kidney, immune system issues or are elderly they may need admission and support for those other systems.

We are getting emails daily with new processes, it is difficult keeping up with the changes, but we are working with the information we have at the time, and that is changing rapidly.

It also impacts on other patient care as the process to go into an isolated room and come out can be three times as long. 

And if a patient requires two nurses at the bedside for a medication, procedure or basic care, that's two nurses away from the rest of the floor for an extended time.

My hospital is not a large one, but does see a lot of presentations normally.

"I don‚Äôt think people realise how long picking orders takes, or how many people suddenly decided it was a good idea to get delivery.

How long does it take you to do a week‚Äôs grocery shopping, 20-30 minutes?

Most medium sized stores have 1,000 customers a day.   If staff took as long as customers to shop, they‚Äôd need 350-500 hours of work, or 43-62 staff on 8 hour shifts.

Staff can be quicker than customers, but it‚Äôs not set up like Amazon, they‚Äôre not going to do it in 2 minutes.  They *might* be able to do your shop in half the time.   If shelves are empty and they have to think and edit orders (would the customer like the 750g bag of rice if the 500g bag is out if stock?) they might not save any time at all.

And one truck can‚Äôt make 1,000 drops a day.  That would be 1 drop every 30 seconds.  You‚Äôd need 10 trucks and a really good algorithm that planned a route so they can do a drop every 5 minutes.  (That still gives them no time to go back to the store and load up again.)

You simply can‚Äôt do delivery for everyone.  Not without massive (expensive!) changes.   You can cover maybe 10-20% of the population.   So they‚Äôre prioritising the elderly.

Which is tricky because the elderly aren‚Äôt used to this, and aren‚Äôt making it easy!  I‚Äôve got a friend who works for an IGA.  They‚Äôre offering a phone-order service for the oldies who don‚Äôt understand the internet. It takes a significant amount of time, because they don‚Äôt know the best way to communicate what they‚Äôre looking for ‚ÄúI need detergent: the yellow bottle‚Äù, want to tell you their life story ‚ÄúI used to use the blue one, but my cousin‚Äôs sister Sally recommended the yellow one‚Äù, and then call up 3 times because they forgot something and want to add it.

"The economy will implode after 6 months of ‚Äòalmost but not quite‚Äô lockdown. 

Eight weeks of extreme isolation would most definitely put downward pressure on the economy, but it could be mitigated somewhat with government help. Then we emerge and start immediately rebuilding.

Instead, ScoMo wants to keep everything open, and effectively shift the responsibility of keeping the economy going to the general public, to whom he‚Äôs also saying ‚Äòstay away from everyone‚Äô.

This way, when the economy tanks, he can‚Äôt be blamed.

When people die, he can‚Äôt be blamed.

A hairdresser that‚Äôs forced to close down for eight weeks will probably survive, especially if a large portion of their overheads (rent, bills, tax etc) are delayed. People can be stood down from their jobs without a heap of hassle if a large portion of their overheads (rent, bills, tax etc) are delayed.

A hairdresser that‚Äôs forced to stay open for 6 months without customers will have to lay staff off before eventually closing.

Two, or even three months of surviving without income but without overheads is largely manageable. Six months of surviving without income and at best partially reduced overheads is almost impossible for most people and small businesses.

Not to mention that those without work will have no money left to spend in the economy in six months‚Äô time. If you implement a compulsory lockdown, and suspend all or the majority of overheads, people keep their money and are able to stimulate the economy once this is all over.",1.0,2020-03-21 00:15:09,47.0

What ever it is there is clearly a problem and I‚Äôd like more action to be taken quickly (primarily way more testing) but I wanted to point out that if our economy collapses it will also cause deaths or possibly even collapse the health care system which would be f\*cked right now.

"I agree with you, but I do think we too often have a bit too much faith in ourselves.

This time we don‚Äôt have a Kevin Rudd steering us through, and I don‚Äôt think Scott really has the rigour to take the strong, decisive, necessary action, and seems to believe the LNP hype that it was Australia in and of itself, and not its leadership that navigated is through the GFC et al.

Rudd may not have been the best leader we‚Äôve ever had, but he‚Äôs been calling for a G20 summit on the coronavirus response since the 28th Feb. He was on CNN on the 4th Feb discussing getting the G20 together to help China fight the virus. 
Rudd has been talking about the economical impact of coronavirus since at least the 8th Feb. I have no doubt that were Rudd our PM now, our economy would be in significantly better shape, the markets wouldn‚Äôt have panicked anywhere near the way they did, and we would be dealing with a trickle of coronavirus cases that would be well managed.

"This was a really good read.

Everyone needs to read this.

It took a fair bit of convincing and I eventually had to put my foot down when my girlfriend told me her sister wanted to come and visit.
We live in a small country town that hasn‚Äôt had a confirmed case yet - but the virus is only 1 town away - and her sister lives at the Gold Coast, works in Brisbane and just came back from a training course in Sydney just this weekend. Three of the biggest hotspots in Australia and she‚Äôs been to all of them as well as airports and whatnot.
I get it - she‚Äôs been stood down, is at home by herself and would like to visit her family (her/my girlfriend‚Äôs parents also live here). But there was no way I was putting my family, my kids, myself, my job (I work in food so am still employed) and my town at risk just so she could not be bored. Not to mention that I would likely have to feed her while she‚Äôs here as that always seems to happen when she comes to town...

I have given up all of my social activities due to this thing and the people I hang out with are low risk as the virus isn‚Äôt even in our town yet. Why would I then let a high risk person into my home!?

It pissed me off that she even asked if she could come tbh",12.0,2020-03-27 04:02:00,48.0

"I just got back from the grocery store.

I didn't go to my closest Woolworths this time. I went to the one an extra 10 minutes away. It is about twice the size.

Although I didn't know what it was called, or that it was a good strategy, I have been social distancing since the day the run on toilet paper started. Well actually, I went to the bottle shop and bought several litres of vodka and a few cartons of beer and then stocked up on pet food and kitty litter (for the pets I have, not 'cause I am weird) and then I started social distancing.

But my local woolworths has been consistently out of stock. I usually do a big shop each fortnight and then a small shop on the 'off weeks' to pick up perishables like fruit and veg. This became impossible. I went from doing the right thing - shopping as infrequently as possible to needing to shop every second or third day.

Today, I finally got back from the shop and it was my first trip there in 7 days. I should not need to go back for another 7 days.

**But the point of this long ramble** \- I've seen very little change in behaviour from other shoppers since this whole thing started. Sure, the shoving and fights seem to have stopped, but people still wander around like zombies, stand right beside each other, sneeze in to their hands and then pick up products. There are a few who are wearing gloves and a couple that are wearing masks, but very few people seem to respect the social distancing. I made a point to thank everyone that made intentional effort to maintain distance. I said ""thank you"" four times. Just four times.

We've all seen the models by now - we need 80-90% of citizens to enforce social distancing, and by my estimation at the shops, compliance is in the single digits. Which means we're boned. Only one of the people that I said 'thank you' to was obviously in a high risk category. The other three were young, fit-looking people that visually appeared healthy. Obviously I can't know anything about their actual health status, but a hundred or so of the people that I saw bumping shoulders, leaning over other people were visually obvious to be in the high risk categories - 60+, significantly overweight, etc.

I think this all comes back to the fact that it's not 'real' for anyone yet. Only 13 people have died and most in NSW. People don't know anyone that is personally affected let alone dead...yet. It's kind of like 9/11 - we knew it was real and that it was happening, but it was kind of nebulous because it was thousands of kilometres away happening to other people. Except unlike 9/11 - it's not a one off event that took months to clean up. This is a rolling event that is rushing towards countries everyday, except the tide won't go out - once it gets here it will keep happening - every day.

 Using just a mask is as imperfect as the elbow cough really. I get no one wants to get this but a mask isn't going to do much if you are in a room with a person sick with COVID-19.

A heap of key control measures implemented in tandem are required to successfully mitigate your potential exposure to this and just wearing a mask might seem well and good but if your not considering the other PPE I can see why people are asking why bother with just a mask.

"This is what I've written and it's specific to my personal context. I'm happy for anyone to use any of my ideas that are relevant to them:

  

Dear Ms Palaszczuk

I am writing to implore you to close Queensland schools. I am an experienced and registered primary school teacher. My job, and the job of every Queensland teacher, is to educate students. In the present climate, we are not being told that the delivery of education is essential. Rather, we are receiving the message that we must provide child care, while other workers are encouraged to work from home.

Teachers, unlike medical workers, do not have the training and resources to control the spread of disease. I work with students who cough, sneeze, spontaneously hug, and accidentally spit when they talk. It is of no comfort to me that students may be asymptomatic if they carry COVID-19 - especially when I have asthma and am immuno-compromised due to cancer treatment. These are issues that are usually easily managed, but not in the current climate. There are no doubt many teachers like me.

Closing schools will not be diabolical for child care - this has not been the case in other countries. Health workers have also been creating networks to facilitate care in anticipation of school closure - these can easily be found online. The argument that schools must stay open to provide care for medical workers is a fallacy, and the Queensland people know it.

Teachers will do everything possible to make schooling at home a valuable experience with the available resources. For many, if not most, this would be on par with traditional online distance education. The argument that schools must stay open so that education is not disrupted is also a fallacy, and the Queensland people know it!

In the current climate, I cannot be provided with a safe workplace.

Please do what is right for Queensland teachers and families.",6.0,2020-03-19 13:03:08,56.0

More testing would mean better quarantine for those who can spread it and warn others early to stay home.

Another major issue would be the communities main source of food is Alice Springs (5 hour drive) or at the resort supermarket (30 minutes, and where the tourists stay). The community shop is expensive and does not have a large range, so the only option is the resort supermarket when you are needing something that the store doesn't stock.

You let people come back into the country months after they were told to come back but didn‚Äôt listen,  then instead of using Police and Army like other states, you give out contracts to private security firms so your mates can make millions, they hire a bunch of cheap inexperienced guards off gumtree FFS, make them work 12hr shifts 7 days a week.
You then allow those returning travellers to complain and not take tests when asked because of their ‚Äúrights‚Äù and what not. 
Now that shit has hit the fan, everyone else‚Äôs rights are being thrown in the bin.

We are relying on casuals to deliver food, stock shelves,  support vulnerable people, answer phone calls, and any number of things that might be needed to prevent cascading disruption.

"I disagree with you. There are plenty of roles that pay the same or more than roles that require university education. Basic Labourers can be outearning nurses easily in a few years - there are multitudes of industries just like this. The universities still fare well, and people (like you) have still chosen to undertake education despite their being other options available - assumingly because you dont want to do those jobs. Thats fine, you shouldnt have to, and the system is set up for that - youve still chosen to spend your 10k on postgrad studies, good for you. 

The people who do undertake those roles though deserve the pay as well. 

The australian skills shortage list is filled with many roles that require no university level formal training if you have the experience too, that is another point in and of itself.

"If your friend wants to post a response to head off the witch-hunt, OP:

‚ÄúTo the person who left a red and yellow, oddly racist letter under my door yesterday:

I am not Airbnb-ing. I had a personal condition which made it hard to do everyday tasks, so some friends came over to help me. (This sentence is optional if privacy likely to be an issue). 

Your accusations are unfounded - your only basis for them is that you saw ‚Äúforeign‚Äù people in the building. I am proud to have a diverse group of friends, and your comments about them were completely inappropriate and frankly unAustralian. And I do know the bylaws, and have kept your letter accordingly.  
(The ‚Äúcomments‚Äù here being letter-writers‚Äô very racist assumption that the only reason your friend would talk to ‚Äòforeign‚Äô people is to charge them money). 

I understand the coronavirus has frightened you, but as a community and a country we need to try to help each other - not lash out at others to try and make ourselves feel better about the risk. 

I‚Äôm afraid my options for physically helping you out are somewhat limited, but Coles and Woolworths are both opening early exclusively for pension card holders, and Coles has said they‚Äôre prioritising the vulnerable for home deliveries, so that may help to reduce your risk. 

If you‚Äôre not comfortable ordering online for home delivery, or need more details about early opening, Coles‚Äô phone number is 1800 061 562 and Woolworths is 1800 000 610. 

I hope this helps you to feel a little safer in an uncertain time.‚Äù

I‚Äôd put a few up - main goal is get a bunch of people in the building to see it and feel bad, and be on your friends side. (If there is actually more than one person mad about this, as it may just be letter-writer - but if your friend is in a building full of bored old busybodies with nothing to do but create trouble while they‚Äôre isolated, they may want to head this off.)

Secondary goal is for letter-writer to see it, feel bad about being nasty when your friend was helpful in return, or failing that, realising a bunch of other people have now seen this response and they won‚Äôt have support if they continue to be pain in the ass to your friend.

And I‚Äôd recommend both keeping the letter and getting your friends  side of story in to the ‚ÄúCouncil.‚Äù (If it is a real thing). They may be able to identify letter write and tell them to knock it off - they have distinctive handwriting, and if seeing ‚Äòforeign‚Äô people is all it takes to set them off then I‚Äôm thinking a lot of people in the building have been sent similar notes.",6.0,2020-03-17 13:23:42,63.0

Lost contact with friends cause when you get married you tend to put most time and effort into your family and just seemed to have lost contact with them. The couple of friends I have spoken to this week have moved to different areas.

Need money to move to a cheaper smaller house but probably easier and cheaper in the long run to just stay here until I can sort myself out.

She has all her family and friends here to help her. One of her friends is a lawyer and another is an accountant so already expecting to lose everything. 

I have had some suicidal thoughts but I won't do that because I will not leave my kids like that. My sister hanged herself when I was 16 and it ruined so many lives for years, even now. Could never do that to my children.

But hey, at least I still have a job working all week for about $200 more than all the people staying home getting jobkeeper. So have no time to even think about moving from this depressing empty house anyway. 

The only thing keeping me going are my kids, and knowing this is a hard time for everyone so I should man up and not be so selfish. Hate my life but love my kids life more. But that doesn't change the fact that I am all alone and scared.

Not sure how it compares to your method, but I think it might be suitable for the community - keeping supplies of proper masks for healthcare workers.

I have basic sewing skills, and have seen a few different sewing patterns for masks (with a pouch/flap for filtration material) I can try and find them again if you're interested? 

As for sewing thread, there is a plastic fishing line type thread that might be better for sterilising. Often sold as 'invisible thread' (though they can be a little thin/breakable, so I would reinforce the seams or use a thicker thread where possible)

If your mum makes masks out of that+sterilisable material, she could ask the hospitals if they will accept it for autoclaving and use, and if not, use them for yourselves and for everyone you know/in your community.

And re: sewing thread - the one I bought was ""Habee Savers invisible thread"" $5 for 3 at woolworths, I did notice it was easier to break than normal thread - so a stronger nylon thread, or even fishing line might be stronger/better (or just go over the seams a few times)
""Nylon Monofilament Thread"" is another name for it


As for elastic/ear loops, I'd recommend ""shirring elastic"" - its the the thin, round elastic on a spool, but if you want something stronger maybe a flat elastic - I have a ton of extra hair ties so I will probably use those 

If you prefer the masks that tie behind the head - particularly for anyone wearing masks for long periods - I find buttonhole elastic can be very useful!

One website that I have found invaluable for information on filters  [Smart Air Filters](https://smartairfilters.com/en/clean-air-blog/posts/)

He does a lot of testing on the various materials/filters, their efficiency, and whether you can wash them

----
I hope some of that helps. I think it'd be easier to make a few of the masks with a pouch, and then just switch out that blue material as a filter (just make sure to wash/disinfect the fabric masks, ideally make enough so you have a few days of 'clean' masks and rotate them) 

70% alcohol is quite good at disinfecting, if your mask wont melt/burn I believe you can disinfect them in the oven. UV light works as well - but of course do your research on your disinfecting method, as many need to be done for a certain period of time, at the correct temperature/UV wavelength, and so on. I'd be careful with autoclaving, as I've seen a few studies and articles with various methods - and autoclaving came out closer to the bottom of the list than I would have thought. I would maybe use another disinfecting method before autoclaving, just to be on the safe side

I am very hopeful that I can remotely organise for you to obtain some surgical wrapping material from a hospital near you.

"I haven't seen any patterns for the duckbill shape, but I'll have another search around and let you know. I don't think it would be too hard, just adjust the fabric shape and have the seam going lengthways (so you have a top and bottom piece, rather than left and right with the fitted masks) it might be a little trickier to sew in a pouch for replaceable filters though. I'll give it a go with some scrap fabric when I get a bit of time and let you know how it turns out?

(that said, I do have a good quality fabric mask and it is much easier to breathe through than a lot of surgical or N95 masks I've used - vogmask. But that could be my personal preference - and of course you don't want masks with valves when it's infectious disease - but I'd base my fabric masks on that sort of shape)

I'll jump onto the facebook group, I very rarely use facebook though so I often check back in and realise I missed a bunch of comments/messages from weeks back, so... It's like my least reliable form of communication. (But just shoot me a msg on here if I seem to just disappear on fb)

And I'd be more than happy to sew up some masks if you can source the material. Need something to do at home anyway - I'm about to make some fabric ones for if/when our healthcare providers run out (my mum is a nurse, but it's an outpatient/private clinic, so it's more monitoring post-op and sleep studies, not actual surgeries and so on) Poor thing has been trying to find one single bottle of hand sanitiser for a month, we're lucky we have a few extra masks from bushfire season - but it's not going to be anywhere near enough if she gets pulled to the front lines.",2.0,2020-03-28 13:53:32,69.0

But please don't wash HEPA filters! It actually reduces filtration efficiency.

What‚Äôs worse is that because it is mild they might not even realise that they should be at home and not at school so transmission will be rampant.

So this virus will spread through schools and onwards to families when students go home. I ask then - What is the point of cancelling mass gatherings, having adults working from home and using social distancing if everyday we are sending our children to mass gatherings called ‚Äúschools‚Äù. This is the weakest link in our social distancing strategy and may be our downfall.

Lack of supervision for students of doctors, nurse etc or the need for grandparents to look after students is often cited as a issue here. I would have thought that in the event of school cancellations, school would retain a core staff to keep school open for those very few families that need supervision for the students where parents work in essential services etc. We could also look at extending the school hours for these small cluster of students to cater for those that might otherwise need before and after school care. It is all workable and schools will do their part, we always do.

"1) No matter what you say or do people will go outside and they will do things that cause them to interact with other people. Even in authoritarian shitholes people will risk DEATH from their government just to go outside. There is nothing you can do short of cutting their limbs off to prevent them doing so and with technology these days that might not be enough.

2) You cannot ""stop"" the outbreak. The idea that you can simply hunker down for 6 months to ""get it out of the way"" is false and isn't going to change the fact that once you emerge it will simply resurface again. What do you do when that inevitably happens? You can only slow it down.

3) That supermarket place you like to go to get things to put into your mouth has 2-3 days worth of food tops. Think about water, electricity, medications, and the dozen other things you don't think about. All require people going out and doing things. Someones gotta make it, someones gotta distribute it, someones gotta pack the shelf, someones gotta stand by the checkout to make sure you're not a degenerate, someones gotta make sure everyones doing that, and someones gotta make sure the government get it's cut. It's all very nebulous and spooky but it's important.


4) In order for the government to do anything it needs to enforce it's laws. It does this through violence, or in more civilized places the threat of violence. What is the worst thing that can happen to you if you continuously violate laws repeatedly? You get thrown in prison. What happens to prisons during a pandemic? They throw you out of them. The police has no stick, it has an imaginary stick and they certainly don't people to figuring this out.


If you are b1g brain you'll recognize these things and plan around it. If it seems half assed that's because it is by design. You impose some restrictions to slow exposure but do not enough to stop it's progress. You impose some social distancing measures but not enough that you'll have to deal with social unrest when people start ignoring your rules and start burning shit down.

By creating corporate tax breaks, privatisation of public resources, and the other crap certain political parties do to benefit billionaires and their hoarded gold, you are directly depriving the Australian economy of huge amounts of money that could be injected into our economy to create more jobs, better wages, better public resources, education, healthcare, infrastructure, and all the other things that make this a good country to live in.

For you the employee it also means at the end of the year you don't need to get a payment summary/group certificate from your employer, because the ATO already has all the details of your pays throughout the year. It is available to you in MyGov instead and your tax return is somewhat simplified as a result.

"It occurred to me that in the STP report you need to have the employees Tax File Number, and on the other end a person must provide a tax file number for their bank account or be charged high levels of tax on interest.

It would be within the data matching capabilities of the ATO to put 2 and 2 together and notice companies reporting one thing and employees receiving something else.

I'm sure some businesses will try it, but they'll be caught and made an example of.

Harder to detect would be say casuals who might only have been earning $250 per fortnight (for example) and the company now pays them $1500. This is the design of the scheme.

A company may be able to convince employees that in exchange for the company registering for the scheme and paying the employees more, then the employee should..... provide some consideration.... back to the employer.  This will be harder to detect.",1.0,2020-04-01 09:25:49,75.0

People will grow tired of this and get loose with the rules then we are beating out strawfires of infections flaring up here and there, harsher rules and lower tolerance from authorities follow.

In my view, shut down early and hard and we buy time for therapies, take pressure of hospital, and then test like crazy to 'find' the virus and contain it. 

Obviously this is blowing up the economy, but it is like this the world over and if it is not, it will be in a few months time. We are all in the same boat, I reckon it is wise to take decisive action.

They say shutting down schools right now is bad because they would stay shut 6months? Why? If this is nothing to worry about? They say keep going to work or school, then why would schools be closed 6months? It's nearly holidays 1-2 weeks early shouldn't change much. They bloody well know this is going to get way outta hand, everyone keeps trusting government.

"Has anyone else noticed that there is a massive cross over between people who don't take the virus seriously and people who were told to keep working basically as normal the whole way through the pandemic? I think alot of that cross over would come from just the fact that being told to not go to work was a pretty big sign of how serious the pandemic was to most people. I also think it would be very hard to mentally juggle both taking the virus seriously and working as normal. To both work on large scale construction sites and take the virus as serious as it is you would have to go to work everyday for the last 5 months thinking; 'the country is willing to risk my life, my families life and everyone I work with's life for the economy'. 
I think because of this alot of the people who are working as normal just try to avoid thinking about the virus at all because if they do it paints a pretty dark image of how much our society cares if they live or die. I'm not trying to excuse there behaviour but trying to explain why and how it would be very easy to think this way in there shoes.

"Hi everyone! 

I just wanted to provide a quick update. 

We received an email earlier today stating that my husband has been granted an exemption, and at the same time we also received his Tourist Visa approval! 

This is amazing news and we‚Äôre very happy. We‚Äôre looking at flights now. 

I know there‚Äôs a bit of a tendency for people to post things like this complaining about their situation, and then when things work out for them suddenly they disappear, or they flip the script and the whole thing ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù and the attitude becomes that it‚Äôs all very simple and if you just follow the rules it‚Äôll work out. 

But that‚Äôs not really my style. I want you all to know that I‚Äôll be keeping up with this thread for any of you that need advice or just want to talk to someone who understands your situation. Sometimes even though there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do, and you‚Äôre just waiting, just being able to talk about it without feeling like your experience is being minimised can make all the difference to your morale. 

Things did work out for us and in the end it didn‚Äôt take that long. But we are in a very lucky situation and we are in the minority of people that had all of these documents ready to go because of our spousal visa application. Not everyone - even married couples - have that, and having to go through this much to prove the value of your partner relationship is not fair. 

I wish all of you the very best with your applications, and if you ever need to talk, please feel free to message me or comment on this thread. I think the more examples we can provide to other people going through this, the better.",5.0,2020-07-01 02:54:30,83.0

Thank you for sharing your experience!

I have a couple of questions: 1. How far out was your expected date of travel was on your application? 2. How many days did you have to wait to hear back from the department regarding your application? 3. Did we (my husband and I) submit sufficient supporting documents [please see explanation below]? 

My situation: I'm an Australian citizen and my husband is an American citizen. We are both currently in the US and intend to fly to Australia in September. We lodged our request to travel July 5 and stated our expected date of travel is September 15. I'm wondering how likely it would be for my husband to get an exemption before then. We stated that the reason my husband wants to travel to australia is that he wants to accompany me to Australia as my US visa is expiring soon and our plan is to settle in Australia for the near future. My husband already holds a valid temporary visa. We submitted the following supporting documents:
- marriage certificate (american certificate)
- statement about relationship (4 pages)
- both passport ID photos
- joint bank statement

They once again replied asking for more documentation, specifically to prove the medical emergencies. We haven‚Äôt lodged the second application for that one yet. 

The unfortunate news of this being that they didn‚Äôt seem to care about our spousal status. They only cared about the extenuating circumstances. It actually seems more difficult to leave Australian than to have someone come here.",1.0,2020-06-29 12:06:28,83.0
"Hey! 

I‚Äôll update the post to let everyone know what‚Äôs happening, but I wanted to address your situation specifically. 

First of all, I‚Äôm really sorry. This is a horrible situation for everyone and having had my relationship as long distance since the beginning, I know the stress and toll that being separated can put on a relationship. Especially for people who are quite young. Being separated indefinitely is a big ask of people in their early twenties. 

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have much good news for you. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll discriminate against you because of your ages, but the more pressing issue is going to be your relationship status. Without being married, being engaged, or being a defacto couple, it‚Äôs a real uphill battle. 

You‚Äôd have to be applying on compassionate grounds, and from everything we‚Äôve seen so far from the myriad of people in this position, being separated from your partner isn‚Äôt considered compassionate grounds. The reason I say your relationship status is a factor is because those people who applied on compassionate grounds due to being separated from their fianc√© or their de facto partner seemed to have greater success, presumably because these people could also demonstrate other types of hardship that would be suffered during the separation: parenting of children, joint financial commitments etc. 

If there‚Äôs anything else you can use - and I know this sounds gross and exploitative and there‚Äôs no nice way to suggest this - like health of close family etc, that would really aid your case. However, you need to be prepared to support those claims with documents.",1.0,2020-06-29 11:48:06,83.0
"From everything I‚Äôve read, one of the caveats that the Australian government is putting on this travel bubble is that people on an Australian passport or whose permanent residency is in Australia would be turned away from other overseas flights from NZ.

So basically I thought of when Germany allow access to Australians which in august and I get an exemption to leave australia to Egypt as I've got properties and used to live there  but instead heading there I change my flight in Dubai to Germany!

Ah, a fellow aus/US couple! 

So, questions first:

1. One week
2. The first attempt we heard back within five days, the second attempt within 9 days
3. Yep, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs plenty of evidence. 

Now, comments: 
Given your intended date of travel, I wouldn‚Äôt expect an answer for quite some time, probably not until a week to 48 hours before your intended flight. So, don‚Äôt panic if you don‚Äôt hear right away. 
Also, keep up with the news. I don‚Äôt know what state you‚Äôre planning on flying into but the rules are changing every day. ScoMo just announced a significant cut to international arrivals: it‚Äôs now capped at 4000 per week, throughout the whole country, but also some states have their own arrival caps. All the states are also expected to announce that return travellers will now have to pay for their own quarantine, so you need to be prepared for that. Again, each state is different and they haven‚Äôt all announced their plans for this, but it‚Äôs close on $4000 in some areas for two people quarantined in the same room. 

There will also continue to be flight rerouting, so, if you have a flight booked to arrive in QLD, they might end up rerouting that at the last minute to WA. At the moment that‚Äôs not the case, but it‚Äôs expected to be so as all the ports try and juggle this new national cap on arrivals. 

There‚Äôa also interstate border restrictions which are being continually updated, so depending on what the situation is by September, you may be looking at an additional quarantine - again, at your own expense - if you need to travel from your arrival state to your home state.",1.0,2020-07-11 04:46:37,83.0

"Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty complex situation, mainly because from all rumours, your destination country is used as an assessment tool. So, if you state one destination country and then end up in another.... 

Look, technically I think once you‚Äôre off the plane after leaving Australia, and through immigration for whatever country you land in, you cease to be Australia‚Äôs problem in terms of the travel ban. There‚Äôs no difference in protocol for returning passengers in Australia dependent on where you‚Äôve been, aside from the countries from which travellers are straight up banned. 

My bigger concern with your plan is that owning houses in another country doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough proof. You would either have to apply to leave on personal business grounds, if those properties are investment properties - and even then I think you‚Äôd need more proof that your physical presence was required at these houses, or your case would be that you ordinarily reside in a different country, citing your owned houses as proof.

">Just wish the media would stop saying we have ""flattened the curve"" because the results of the lockdown would not have even begun to show yet.

Yes, the flattening so far has not been due to the lockdown, but due to other measures on social distancing and border closures/self-isolation rules announced on weekend of March 14-15.

The lockdown can only reduce the spread further I think.

You're right. The curve is not fully flat yet. I don't know if it has to be fully flat - a highly infectious virus like this may never get to zero growth.

The main concern is slowing its spread and preventing peak demand for ICU beds at a given time.

Typically patients need ICU beds for 15 days for treatment, before someone else can use it. So if the number of cases grows by ~5% per day, the total ICU demand should remain relatively stable.

Currently, Covid-19 patients use up <5% of total ICU beds (84 ICU patients, 2000+ ICU beds nationwide).

Current daily rate of growth in cases (averaged over last 5 days to smooth) is 7%. We're not fully there yet, but working well towards it.",21.0,2020-04-02 09:20:38,85.0

"**COVID-19 testing**

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for clinical purposes and population surveillance.

Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population. This variability also affects reported case-fatality rates.

"No. Because ICU demand at a given time is a function of active cases at that point in time. It is not driven by the cumulative number of cases.

China had 80,000 cumulative cases. They have probably no more than a few hundred ICU demand now, if that. Sweden has only 5,000 cumulative cases but similar number of ICU demand, because the rate of growth in Sweden has been very fast and thus most of Sweden's cases are recent, active cases.

So cumulative cases cannot give you any indication of ICU demand, only active cases can. On average, about 2-3% of *active* cases are estimated to need an ICU bed. And regardless of the number of cumulative cases, if the case growth rate is 5%, and the recovery rate is similar, the total number of active cases will remain relatively stable at a given point in time.

separate point:
We currently have had a cumulative total of 5,352 cases. Again, not all are active - some have recovered, others have died.
You're right - If the number of cumulative cases were to grow at a constant 5% daily rate each and every day, theoretically every Australian will have had an infection at some point before October.

That sort of straight exponential model is not suitable for analysing epidemiological spread however - I suspect it is more of a stochastic process, since those that already had the infection and recovered will be immune and the more immune people there are the lower the transmission speed will be for the virus.",2.0,2020-04-03 09:27:46,85.0

 Some us think they should  suspend our services and redeploy us in Services Australia - Centrelink, to help with the surge of folks that need assistance. 


Some of us started using our discretion measures to make appts via phone instead of f2f because so many of our clients are sick, high risk and/or mature aged.

"Right.. Look every hospitality job I've been forced to take through this agency  (they're far away and the pay fucking sucks) has screwed me over on one way or other. The last one I waited literally over two months for to start, TWO MONTHS, and then I  was promised 45 hours in the first week (in writing by Sureway), I got six. Then when I told the owner that this simply didn't pay my bills and that I quit so I could find another job (after being dicked  around for months) the pussy then dobbed me in for not taking the job, cue the argument with my client officer over turning down work... My point was *What work? PromisesDO NOT pay bills* then I was promised more work and then they shut down cause the bushfires. 

Two months. One shift and dobbed in and threatened with breach if I didn't take it.

That was just the last one... There areix other ones.. I won't bore you.

The time between infection and death can be as long as 4 weeks,44.0,2020-04-01 03:09:39,89.0
"Well I have two theories - the Dorothy Henderson Lodge residents are only just starting to pass away over the past week. The first infection there was over 3 weeks ago so I would suspect more deaths over the next week or two that is representative of the increase in cases since. It takes an average of 17 days for victims to die based on sources I have read so this is consistent with that data. Also ICU cases have increased quite a lot in the past week.

Secondly, I don‚Äôt think that we test people after they die for Covid-19. I do know they barely test you at all if you haven‚Äôt been overseas - even now after the changes. I can‚Äôt find daily updated statistics for deaths in Australia so can‚Äôt really prove whether there has been respiratory related deaths increase over the past two weeks.",24.0,2020-04-01 03:08:22,89.0
"As others have pointed out there is a lag time of 17 days to 4 weeks between initial infection and death, so the deaths now are reflective of infection level 2-4 weeks ago. There's also an incubation period before symptoms show and we're not testing those without symptoms so the case numbers also reflect what it looked like 1-2 weeks ago. There's also the point that we seem like we're currently able to intubate almost all of the people who need it in hospital so a lot who would die haven't because of effective treatment. 

I expect when we start to have the hospitals buckle under case load and those infected over the last week or two start showing up we'll have a lot more of all the stats jumping up. The lag time in stats is hard to conceptualise and take into account. It sounds like the hospitals are starting to see a lot of likely cases come in whereas a few weeks ago it was mostly the worried well. We'll have to see where we're at in 2 weeks i think but the fact we aren't overrun yet means that community spread was probably fairly minimal 3 weeks ago. There's signs of hope but we're not close to being out of the woods yet.",19.0,2020-04-01 03:53:24,89.0
There is a lag time from infection to death and remember that 80% of people will just think they had a bad cold or flu and continue on.,8.0,2020-04-01 03:46:12,89.0
"If you're talking about deaths already happening that might not be recognized as coronavirus cases, note that when die, a doctor still has to sign a death certificate as to cause of death; someone killed by coronavirus will almost always have been in hospital at the time (you don't tend to just die on your feet, you get sicker and sicker), and will have a pretty distinct constellation of symptoms even without testing. Widespread testing might pick up a few cases that might have been recorded as something else -- but not many. Widespread testing will grow the denominator while barely (if at all) changing the numerator.

If instead you mean ""if there are a lot of people in the community who are presently undiagnosed, won't a small percentage of them die in the future because there's a delay between infection and death, and that will push up the number of deaths as time goes on?"" then sure, that's absolutely true, but the effect isn't as large as it might seem (you might well need to multiply the cases by 10 or more, but the number of deaths from only those presently infected won't grow nearly as much). That's what people in the survival analysis game call *censoring* (we don't yet know the outcome for a person who has the illness). It's possible to account for that if you have good numbers on the cases as a whole and good data on typical cases (ie. if you're testing the community widely enough, not just the sick and the known-to-be-exposed)",5.0,2020-04-01 06:23:52,89.0
"Also, if you get sick enough to go to hospital, you're a chance to get tested. If you're just walking around town going to work and sharing lunch sheds and alimaks with 400 other tradesmen, but aren't symptomatic, you can be spreading it but you won't see a test until you end up in hospital, or we change our criteria",5.0,2020-04-01 04:56:11,89.0
"You are correct, there would be significantly more deaths and hospital admissions if community spread was common.  You could estimate the number of cases by dividing the number of deaths by the average mortality rate.  At the moment the known cases and deaths are close to the expected values.

Note that there are significant time lags between infection, diagnosis and death.  A two week delay could mean that estimated infection numbers are out by a factor of 10.  You can't expect precision when the virus can double the infection rate every 3 or 4 days.",12.0,2020-04-01 03:43:30,89.0

"Because since passing the 100 cases mark we have had slower growth rates in cases than NZ, all of Europe, the americas and most of Asia except Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong. Our case mortality rate is one of the lowest in the world which also suggests we have high rates of testing. And if a GP has clinical concerns they get tested regardless of other criteria,  which reflects the broadest scope for patients being able to access testing anywhere in the world that im aware of",8.0,2020-04-01 09:56:38,89.0

MY SYMPTOMS  


I first had a very, very minor runny nose on the plane. I was wearing a P2/N95 mask, and I just attributed this to the usual air pressure changing, breathing under a mask etc.

Tuesday, badly running now. A bit of sneezing. A few small insignificant coughs. Slept poorly, feeling a bit hot and cold.

Wednesday, still more runny nose, lots of sneezing. Feeling tired, but I hadn't slept well. Fell asleep early on the couch, super tired, but then woke up later and couldn't get back to sleep. Queezy tummy not sure if related.

Thursday woke up feeling crap. Blowing nose still. Minor tighness in my chest. Minor shortness of breath, like really minor. Called the hospital. They called me back a bit later, lots of questions, arranged testing for the next morning. Slight temperature.

Friday, went and had the test in the morning. Came home and went back to bed, tired and muscle aches. No temperature.

Saturday, feeling a bit better but still crappy. Got a call early evening to let me know the bad news. Blowing nose etc. More coughing. Stressed, couldn't sleep.

Sunday. Slept in. Lots of talking to people and things like this. Very very stressed. Blowing nose. Coughing a bit more but still not heaps. some stomach soreness but might just be stress and not sleeping well.

How can we expect our students to become fluent in an online learning platform that they're completely unfamiliar with, when our students aren't as digitally competent as we assume (I had to teach a Yr 9 student how to copy and paste and attach a file to an email last week)? 
What about our students who don't own a device, or have wi-fi at home (they exist, especially in socially and economically disadvantaged areas)?

But I don't think that is the only reason the title is misleading. For the factory she is talking about I assume she means ""rate of asymptomatic infection"". There are a few problems with that. Firstly, an interview isn't really a reliable source for that type of claim. We should track a peer reviewed source for her claim before stating it as fact. Secondly, that number even if accurate wouldn't prove it was the masks that was causing that low rate of symptoms, entirely or even partly, so it would take another separate peer reviewed article to show that. Thirdly, we couldn't assume from that number in that factory that it would be 95% everywhere else, so it would take a third peer reviewed article to show that. She seems confused about what she is even claiming and she definitely doesn't name any studies or provide any persuasive evidence that the masks are causing an increase in the proportion asymptomatic cases.

I totally agree. No disagreement here!

"I'm a french backpacker in Australia. The reason I choose to stay is simple. My grandma is with my parents in lockdown in France for the last 2 weeks. Travelling the world to come back would put them at risk to get infected.

Besides it's also safer for me here in Tasmania. I have a house. Money will be tight if we stay in lockdown for a long time but I will manage. Some others backpackers don't have this luxury, they used to live cheaply by staying in car. 

The reality is we are on WORKING holiday visa. Most of us come in Australia because we can easily find jobs. Mostly the kind Australians doesn't want to do. That way we can finance our roadtrips/holidays. 

We provide cheap labor and bring money to the economy by living and traveling in Australia. That's the only reason the gvt aggree to have so many backpackers. That's why we have to do 88 days of farm work to get a second visa. That's why since this year whe can do a third year if whe do 179 days of farm work. 

All this to say we're not some rich kids coming in Australia only to party. A lot of backpackers come here because they have low income jobs back home. They earn more money here. For some of them, it's the only way to save money to travel.

So it's normally a win/win situation for us and your country. If nothing is done right now, it will be a lose/lose  situation. Backpackers will run out of money, will get desesperate and will break the lockdown to try to find work.

We also pay tax in Australia. More than Australians at equal salary. We don't have access to medicare. I don't think it's illogical that the gvt would help use in this situation. For example it would help me a lot if the gvt let me access the money from my superannuation during the lockdown. Btw the gvt tax us 65% of it when we claim it at the end of our visa.

But I agree with some of you that think my gvt should do more for us too. There are not much difference during those time being unemployed in France or in Australia. Hopefully both gvt will make their stand clearly so we know what we should expect.

I hope all of you will stay safe and this crisis will not put a riff between Australians and backpackers. We are here because we love your country and its people.",2.0,2020-04-01 02:11:15,99.0

"There are some people who don't want to go home, so they may need to force it. Offering flights may not cut if their home countries are badly effected.

I can't afford the medical bills in my country and have no insurance if I get the virus (USA) so if I happened to be somewhere else where the medical care was cheaper when this all started I'd probably stay and pay out of pocket. Before I rebooked I was headed to Asia early this year. I would've stayed and just paid the medical bill. No idea if cheap medical care applies to Australia though.

Note: This is not everyone's situation. I have a few grand, an understanding job and speak the language of the country I was going too.
So I could realistically wait this out as a backpacker somewhere else.

I'm not looking for judgment on this idea, just pointing out a possibility.

Stop pretending Australians were ready and backpackers were just being stupid - I live in regional SA, my family is in France and I knew how bad it would get in Australia but meanwhile most people here in SA were not taking this virus seriously, not washing their hands, pretending everything would be fine but at the same time hoarding TP. Scott Morrison waited for ages before taking any measures and the country is still not on total lockdown (it should be). For some backpackers this was a dream not just a year off to party, and they only get one work holiday visa in Australia in their entire life, they didn't want to risk wasting it and losing it forever without knowing how long this situation would last. I agree that there are silly backpackers out there who make poor life choices but no one is perfect. And whether you like it or not, they are allowed to be here and they are part of your society.

"This whole Australians don't want to do this work is BULLSHIT, Australians don't get the chance to do the work because it's cheaper to hire a foreigner. Just watch how many Australians will be employed in agriculture now when new seasons crops are ready to harvest in a couple of months but no new backpackers are arriving to pick the crops. Farmers will have no choice but to hire Australians. Backpackers would still come to our country even if they couldn't get work, have you seen how beautiful Australia is? So this whole belief that if we didn't give you jobs our economy would sink is ridiculous. Most backpackers come here to work so they can fund their travels around the country and PARTY you are not here because we are desperate for you to pick our fruit and veges and you are doing us a favor.

Have you ever done picking jobs before ? It's hard work, last only a few months at best and it depends on weather. Most of them are on piece rate. I was picking apple last week. 3000 kg per day. Do you think Australian will want to do this kind of job when it's going back to normal? 

Do you think french pick their fruits and vege in France ? Only a few do it because they don't want to. So we have people from east Europe or North Africa do it.

"It is not cheaper to hire backpackers, why does everyone think that? Backpackers are paid either on piece rate or award rates, which are the same for  everyone, regardless of their visa. The reason there are few Australians working on farms or picking fruit is that it is casual work with no security, very hard work, and it only lasts a few weeks generally, so it would be suitable for young and fit people without a full time job and who are willing to work only for a short period of time. There are employers who want to hire foreigners so they can take advantage of them by giving them crap accommodation, late payment, etc. and then they are good employers who would hire anyone with the skills and willingness to work, Aussie or not. I've met both types. Backpackers are not employed because they're cheaper but usually because they're easy targets, and they come and go with the seasons. A lot of farmers only need help for a few weeks, they can be in remote places, sometimes without accommodation, so it's the perfect job for young travellers, not so much for locals who probably want a bit more security than that.",1.0,2020-04-01 21:29:32,99.0

The young Australians who want to find job in hospitality will always find jobs. They have a big advantage over us as native and fluent english speaker.
 I mean you said it yourself that most Australians would spend more if the jobs go to native. Maybe it's not all about money but the industry environment. Maybe some young Australians aspire to better jobs. 

Anyway I think you (the average Australian?) just try to simplify a very difficult problem about unemployement in Australia. If it was this simple to solve the issue your gvt would have done it already. 

The Australian  gvt could have forced everyone to go home weeks ago too. I don't think you can call Italians, for example, foolish because they didn't want to go home when hundreds were dying everyday in their country.

So we could be much higher every day and not realise it until they start having the capability of testing anyone with symptoms regardless of whether or not they‚Äôve been overseas or in contact with someone who has.

Companies also need to adapt as there are still too many not allowing workers to work from home (who are able to), and asking for sick workers to get a letter showing they‚Äôve tested positive before being allowed to self isolate for 2 weeks. We might need to put in place a document saying ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt test, but needs to self isolate‚Äù.

"I'm sorry but I don't think that is a reasonable estimate.

For one, your'e including people with mild symptoms to get a percentage that attempts to describe purely asymptomatic cases. Secondly, I believe as we have a stricter (more limited) testing regime that excludes a large group of people, it doesn't really make sense to try and draw conclusions about the untested population using data from confirmed (tested) cases only. Extreme care should be taken when extrapolating data from something so complex like an epidemic.

However, I remember reading about cases where they tested entire towns and found like 4% positive cases with about 1.5% (of the town) testing positive and showing no symptoms. I just cant find the article now so take it with a grain of salt...",1.0,2020-03-28 04:24:49,103.0
"Yes its very complex and the accuracy is non existent, the data is also very minimal. Its sort of hard to take that town testing data very far either as we don't know what stage of infection spread they're in, how far along the incubation period people are etc. Taking that as gospel though gives you 37% asymptomatic which seems like a decent estimate if a little conservative. 

Just from a sense of the overall data we have and acknowledging that its deeply flawed I'd think something like 30-80% asymptomic or mild symptom carriers is reasonable but by no means definitive, from that i think it's reasonable to think there's reason to believe we have somewhere between 2x and 30x cases in australian infection clusters. I think between 5x and 10x is most likely. 

I agree with you though that estimates are very loose as the data is deeply lacking for any real analysis.",1.0,2020-03-28 04:40:56,103.0

"Oh it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs not that bad.

If you look at how fast countries are doubling the rate of infection after reaching over 100 cases you can see that Australia is doubling every 4 days rather than every 2 or 3 like the US/UK. Our rate of spread is lower, our exponential not quite as drastic.

"Seems pretty sound logic to me. The thing to consider with lockdowns is that your points are based on conjecture and not any scientific research that i can gather. Its fairly obvious that the largest risk factor is being inside in close quarters with someone who is shedding virus for a significant period of time but we know next to nothing about how much the risk is diminished by removing any of those factors and it may be some time until we have the scientific resources to properly study transmission risks. Worth noting that we knew an even smaller fraction of not much 2 months ago when lockdowns were first mooted so they seemed like the most reasonable cautious response. 

The other factor is that lifting restrictions sends the message to people that it's over. It's far from over and in fact it seems pretty clear that the next two weeks will decide how bad our second wave in Melbourne and Sydney is. We should pull out all stops to make sure we don't see scenes that happened just before the second wave of spanish flu in America, people celebrating in the streets etc. 

At the end of the day it seems plain that relaxation of lockdown should be focused on essential workplaces and low risk social interaction. To open schools to any serious extent, resume large offices and large scale public transit is suicide imo and undoes all the effort put in over the past 6 weeks.",13.0,2020-05-05 00:13:09,109.0

"1. I think everyone was surprised how well we did. I am surprised and also would like to understand why. I think part of it was timing, we were maybe just in time. One more weekend of sporting events and other large social gatherings and we might have seen for each virus seeder in attendance 20 or 30 new seeders leave, which would have made a huge difference. So I'm speculating we didn't have a wildfire because we had less spotfires at the outset of social distancing rules being introduced. For example I read that there was a particular soccer match that went ahead in Italy that probably shouldn't, that could be traced as the source of a huge number of infections, that as we know led to a horrible situation for them. That could've been our Grand Prix, for example. There's some critical points in infection where a few days can make a huge difference, due to exponential growth. Again just declaring that I'm speculating, I really don't know.
2. It makes sense for more and more localised lockdowns as we have better testing data. Ultimately we don't want the blunt approach of ""we don't know who has it, so assume everyone has it and lockdown"". Preferable is huge amounts of testing, and a big response to what the test data reveals. The magic trifecta is test->trace->isolate. You test heavily so you know who has it, you trace heavily so you know who they've been in contact with (this is why they want the app on our phones) and finally you isolate heavy so all the infected people you find in your contact trace get locked down. If you ""lose the trace"" in an area, then you might have a regional lockdown. I can imagine soldiers being deployed at checkpoints at some point in our future, to manage this scenario for regions of Australia that have outbreaks. All of this is the ""surgical strike"" rather than the blunt instrument of  country-wide isolation. Google search the article ""the hammer and the dance"" by Tomas Pueyo and I would say the government's playbook is contained therein, ie we have just lived through the hammer, time to start the dance.  The dance sucks. It lasts for months or years. Lots of people die. You're just trying to keep death velocity under the ceiling imposed by the capacity of the health system.
3. Even with borders closed, if we ended social restrictions tomorrow, infections would rise rapidly. This is why we have to start ""the dance"", and just choke the infection rate with the right balance of measures to keep R\_eff < 1 as you've said. Again, I don't think the blunt instrument of a travel ban will continue, it will become more nuanced, some countries banned outright, others allowed in with some quarantine period. Travel will definitely be a pain in the arse for some time. The need to quarantine both sides of an international trip, and in both directions will be the test of people's commitment to their need for travel. It's a bit like life during wartime for a while now in some aspects, it super inconvenient, highly disruptive, it just sucks. My late grandmother  lived in London during WWII, through the blitz. Three times had to move due to her family home being being bombed. I keep reminding myself, at least we're not laying in bed every night waiting for bombs to start falling. Not to downplay the current crisis. The current situation is bad news in any dimension you care to analyse it, but there's some hope to be found in the fact that we don't have to deal with this shit while entire nations actively try to annihilate us.",18.0,2020-05-05 00:42:03,109.0

Anyway, yes, it still seems possible to eradicate the virus within Australia, if we adopt some unique and radical measures, some of which I already suggested. This defeatist attitude that we are going to have to live with it indefinitely is extremely disappointing. The onset of community transmission is not a cue to give up. At the same time, the measures have to be smart, sensible, and calculated. Wide-scale lockdowns and shutdowns of varying degrees have become the default method around the world to try to combat it. Some countries had no choice because either they waited until it was too late (US, UK, Spain, Brazil), others were unfortunate because of the explosive nature of the outbreak there (Italy). However, it seems to me the best way would be to localise and contain, and remain 10 steps ahead of the virus early on, which is what we had a chance to do. For weeks, it was in the media that Bondi was a hotspot. So why the hell did they not impose a stricter isolation of that area for example? They just let it disperse into other suburbs.

In Italy news of a quarantine was leaked to the media before it was implemented.  People evacuated the quarantine zone and spread Covid-19 all around the country.

How about the aged care facility in Sydney where 60 people have been infected and 15 people have died?  Whatever local restrictions they implemented at the facility clearly didn't work.  

Contact tracing and local restrictions can work well, but isolating affected areas tends to doom those within the area to a higher chance of infection, with small gaps in the restrictions allowing wider community spread anyway.",1.0,2020-05-05 03:23:16,109.0

"This is why we wash our produce. We have a sanitisation station outside our house which is basically a table with a spray bottle of methylated spirits. Any packaging we can remove goes into the bin, fresh produce goes into a plastic tub that goes to the sink for washing, everything else gets a spritz of metho, which evaporates quickly, and/or a wipe down. Shopping bags go into the washing machine.

You don't have to witness people doing anything to sanitise what you bring into the house. Assume everyone has the virus, including yourself, and assume that things have been touched. Be aware, not anxious, and assume responsibility for your own health. Don't rely on others to be clean, we've got all types of folks in the community including people with dementia, people on medication, health issues that trigger obsessive behaviours, so all kinds of behaviours in the supermarket.

Her behaviour seems over the top but perhaps if you'd asked her if she needs help instead of watching her in disgust for 5-10 minutes you might understand why she was doing that.

I mean, lots of us have to pick up items to read the ingredient (obviously not eggs).  I'm allergic to a common ingredient. If it's in there, I have to put the product back and find one that doesn't have the ingredient. I sanitise my hands before I go in and after I come out but obviously there's going to be lots of touching in between. 

I don't use my phone in the supermarket until I have to get my card out of it at the end, and I sanitise my phone too (not with metho). Very important not to answer your phone in the store.

I always wear a mask to the supermarket or any store and I am always the only person wearing a mask.

That is the worse thing you can do. Seriously, do you want salmonella? Washing eggs unless you use them straight away is a good way to get salmonella poisoning. Eggs have a natural membrane that keeps bacteria out. Washing the shell destroys the membrane and allows bacteria in. And unlike the Covid-19 virus, which won't infect eggs, bacteria love the inside of eggs and will grow even if refrigerated (although slowly).

Excessive washing destroys the natural ecosystem of harmless flora and fauna on your skin, making you more vulnerable to aggressive disease-causing bacteria. So you have that to look forward too as well.",9.0,2020-04-14 12:59:49,110.0

Because the metho dries so quickly, it likely does not have enough time on the surface to kill the virus, in the same way that soap has to have contact with our hands for 20 seconds before we rinse (someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong?).
I too spray down my groceries, but I mix in a household cleaning spray in with the metho so that it helps evaporation take longer. Calculated to be approx no less than 70% alcohol. 
I shamelessly spray them down in the open air car park outside my local coles. Since they are no longer bagging our groceries, I just put them all back into my trolley, and bag them at my car once they are sprayed, pointing the spray into the boot. I‚Äôm noticing that being confined in the bag directly after spraying keeps them moist for longer (insulated fabric bags). The only exception to this procedure is unpackaged fresh food. This goes in its own bag, in the back seat and washed once home. 

And regarding your card that you keep in your phone, do you have a pocket that you can keep the card in ready for use at the register? 
I also store my cards in my phone (who doesn‚Äôt these days), but I just think there are so many nooks and crannies on my phone that I could miss (I have a pop socket and a card holder) and it‚Äôs a process that just takes a long time to do well. 

Instead, I have a sandwich bag that I put my phone in while out, then spray the bag down before the phone comes out of the bag. It stays in the car so I can reuse it.

I don't mean to tell you how to manage your risk, just letting you know some facts about it.

If you are comprehensively disinfecting packaged items (eg alcohol spray), you don't also need to give them the extra days to make sure the virus is dead.

Things being contaminated when picked isn't an issue as the virus would not survive over the duration all of that processing takes (days I assume), and I doubt it can survive freeze-thaw cycles.

I don't know why you mentioned your sink is stainless steel (that's a good thing for cleanliness). I have a health condition so we are being very careful and get deliveries that are left at the door. We then alcohol spray and wipe all packaged goods as they are brought in, while wearing gloves.

Fresh produce is collected into a very large metal bowl, and simply comprehensively washed with warm soapy water and left to dry on the counter for a couple of hours - this has worked for us and there would be no reason to be concerned - it is the same as washing your hands with warm soapy water as a method to destroy the virus.

Of course priority for testing has to go to those who are likely to have Covid-19, not any ol' Joe with a sniffle who wants attention. The country can only do so many tests at a time, and if everyone who wanted a test got one, they would be overloaded.

Priorities have to be made, and if you aren't a health care worker, and you haven't been in contact with any overseas travellers or known Covid cases, then you're a low priority, sorry.

By the way, the fact that your two kids are sick too means it's probably not Covid-19, but likely the flu or pneumonia. So far, young children don't seem to get Covid-19 very often, and when they do, the symptoms are usually mild.

Two additional tests to confirm recovery are only needed for *severe cases that require hospitalization, or confirmed positives for healthcare/aged-care workers*.

90% of cases do not require hospitalization. Total number of hospitalized cases across Australia is ~500. Suppose they take two extra tests for them to add 1,000 to the test count - i.e. 40 tests per million people. We performed 11,000 tests per million people - what sweet difference does it make if it was 10,960?

Moreover, the procedure to take negative PCR swabs to confirm recovery is established in other countries as well, e.g. US. So it makes no difference at all on a relative scale.

And if you somehow manage to convince yourself that our cases are low only because we don't test people - then why the fuck does the UK report 3 times as many cases as we do on a per capita basis, when they perform only a quarter of the tests we do, again on a per capita basis? Or why the U.S. has 5 times as many cases as we do on a per capita basis, when they perform only a third of the tests we do on a per capita basis? Following your perverted logic, those countries should hardly be announcing any new cases at all!?

"> But the mixed messaging of what is truly essential has shoppers out buying candles and t-shirts in a busy close and confined shopping centre.

I can see why the government doesn't want to publicise this, but now that the disease is out in the community, the *one* thing that will end the epidemic is herd immunity. That's it. A vaccine suitable for mass use is probably two years away, and that's on an *extremely* accelerated and risky schedule. So its herd immunity, or its nothing.

Since 90+ percent of people who get this will only have mild symptoms, what we want is lots of young, fit, healthy people to catch it, spend two weeks home sick with ""the beer flu"",^1 and then be immune,^2 while the elderly and immune compromised stay isolated and don't catch it.

Yes, it's risky. Even the young and healthy can die from Covid-19 if they are unlucky. But most of them won't, and *far* fewer than if the elderly get it.

And what other choice is there? We can't shut down the whole country and lock people in their houses for a year or three until there is a vaccine, and even if we could, the cure would be worse than the disease.

So, and this is my guess, the government wants people out buying ""candles and tee-shirts"", but not too many, and not too often. Its a fine line to walk.

And they can't exactly say so, because given the choice between ""a small number of young people will die, or a large number of old people will die"", the average Aussie will demand that the government wave a magic wand so that nobody dies, there is no economic crash, and no tax bill to pay for it all afterwards. And a pony and a slice of the magic pudding for desert.

We do have good evidence from the [over two hundred thousand](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/04/health/recovery-coronavirus-tracking-data-explainer/index.html) recovered Covid cases overseas that the majority of people, especially those with only mild cases, will [make a full recovery with no long term damage](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-04-04/what-is-recovering-from-coronavirus-like/12119282).

As for the sterility thing, that was literally [pure supposition](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_148559) on the part of a couple of scientists who raised a question in a discussion group about the virus possibly using similar biochemical pathways that also occur in testes. In other words, it is 100% a wild guess with zero evidence for it.

> If we could just do rigorous testing and contact tracing like Singapore

We are doing rigourous testing, Australia is close to the top of the world in testing on a per capita basis. We do [more testing than South Korea, Italy and Singapore](https://www.healthpolicy-watch.org/covid-19-testing-trends-globally-regionally/).

So by all means continue to insist that we should cut our testing levels back to Singapore's level, because if there is anything Australia's 24 million people need it is to take lessons from a toy-town country the size of Sydney run by an authoritarian government that cares more about face than results. /s",1.0,2020-04-06 16:55:18,112.0
"> You say herd immunity like influenza immunity is a thing

It is. That's why flu epidemics die out **long** before everyone has caught the disease: once enough people are immune to a specific virus, the epidemic dies out even though there are still millions of people who haven't caught it. Herd immunity in action. (Did you think that the virus came with a use-by-date? ""Stop infecting people on 5th August"" sort of thing?)

> even vaccines rarely work when it comes to flu like sickness

Flu vaccines are typically [about 40-60% effective](https://www.uabmedicine.org/-/flu-strains-explained-and-how-the-vaccine-works) in preventing illness, and may have a benefit in reducing severity in cases where people still catch a similar (but not identical) strain.

But why are you taking about the flu? Covid-19 is a corona virus, one of about seven which are known to infect humans. About four are quite mild; three are considered dangerous.

"I think the main sticking point is what happens when a contact match has been made.

Under the G/Apple framework, a notification is presented to the user that they might have been in contact with a case and need to go get tested. Nobody else is notified.

With CovidSafe, the health authorities are given that list more or less automatically to then do their contact tracing and notifications (and tell you to immediately isolate) There are legitimate privacy and liberty concerns with this approach. If a similar app was used the US, this also raises issues about being stuck with a hospital testing bill or, for about 4% of residents, attracting the attention of immigration enforcement.

I think the CovidSafe approach was the right call at the time when we really thought we'd have many orders of magnitude higher number of cases to deal with. Assuming Victoria's situation gets under control, I think the more privacy centric and subtler G/Apple approach is better.

In all seriousness, though, sometimes personal liberties must be given up for the collective good. Some people's selfish desires to go about their usual business may end up costing someone's life.

Yes, you may come into contact with people who are young and healthy, but some of us live with our more vulnerable parents.

It's the same with testing. The number of people who refuse is staggering. Some of us have parents in their 60s or older who still work to pay the bills and rent, but evidently some people only care about those who have mortgage and/or have the luxury to be able to ""lock themselves away"". How about we lock people away who refuse to get tested with symptoms and show up to work, and who try to make heroic escapes from hotel quarantine or when they should be isolating at home.

"Yes, a 6 week lockdown is disastrous for the economy. However, I'm talking about a short, sharp semi-lockdown and testing blitz, perhaps not as extreme and extensive as NZ. A 3 or 4 day shutdown of a particular LGA will probably not cause a lot of economic damage. Vulnerable residents and businesses in the area could even be compensated. Victoria has done something like this, with crisis payments for people who can't work. Airlines and other industries are laying people off, but I wonder, has Alan Joyce offered to take at least a small pay cut? Have the politicians?

Also, it is probably a little naive to say that all the new cases are now immediately in isolation. Unless we put a policeman at the door of everyone who is supposed to be isolating, we can't be sure. By everyone I mean anyone who is even suspected of being a close contact, not just a confirmed positive case. I mean, do they actually put people's contact details to good use when a venue is a confirmed hotspot? The police and ADF should immediately contact all visitors and direct them to isolate, and escort them to their homes, and guard the residence for the required isolation period. This is what Andrew Bolt has been saying all along. I don't often agree with him, but I must say he has a point here. Also, I have heard stories of people with flu-like symptoms going to work. When they are asked to go and get a test, they go home and put it off, and when they return it becomes apparent that they haven't been tested.

Also, those old cases that are probably recovered would have been moving around the community, potentially seeding it.

There are cases of young people getting seriously ill and even dying from this around the world. I have the feeling that the government is willing to take the chance to let a few people get infected, with potentially serious complications, as long as the health system (and of course the precious economy) isn't overwhelmed.

"Good point.

I have no doubt the divorce rate would go up, depression rate might go up, together with crime rate, domestic violence etc after restrictions released. However we are very lucky to be in Australia where death rate is still relatively low though climbing. If you look back to China, Italy in the beginning of the pandemic, those are the real reflection of death rate when the virus goes out of control. And if you look at the US, that's what death rate looks like when the government sort of did something but infact did none, to stop it :165k deaths in a matter of 4-5 months. That, I don't think will be higher than those above-mentioned deaths all. 

Put the number aside, COVID 19 is not just about the death rate. It's the uncertainty of what physical damages this virus can cause on a human body, which could collapse our health care system, which will then cause overall healthcare congestions. It will also paralyze the working industries when more and more people get infected and unable to work. 

Having watched my colleagues and friends gone through lockdowns in China, Italy, and have gone through a tough time in Singapore, Malaysia, HK, S Korea, they have all come out fine. It was very stressful at the time when restrictions first applied, then they got abit used to it though still uncertain for the next step, and now they are either back to a new normal that they are comfortable with.

No individual would wish such a brutal, heartless lockdown upon their worst enemy, for the absolutely pointless outcome of only not *recording* any transmissions for 100 days - and just to go back to square one again.

Here in NSW, the lockdown we had was significantly more relaxed. No infant was ever denied from daycare. Anyone could get their takeaways. You could shop at many shops you want or go to your local butcher.
Since the lockdowns were lifted in May, we were able to enjoy pretty much the same level of freedoms as NZ had.

"It *did* eliminate it, from the community. So did most of Australia, in fact (with the exception of Victoria, which continued to have small amounts of community transmission in May and June, before it started to spread more widely). That was always the goal. Even Jacinda Ardern said they will eventually get more cases, given that the borders are not completely closed, and hotel quarantine obviously does carry risks. Well, now it's happened. They just mentioned that the NZ outbreak is linked to quarantine breaches. Hopefully they will learn from this and fix any holes in the quarantine system, and get it under control by jumping on it.

There was a lot of confusion and disagreement regarding which strategy we are taking. Those arguing against ""elimination"" said that it was impossible, due to the porous nature of our (any) borders. They are right, but the goal has always been zero community transmission. Even  Scott Morrison said it, he called it ""aggressive suppression with the goal of zero community transmission"". That is a mouthful, so most just called it ""elimination (from the community)"".

In order to achieve this goal, some form of lockdown is necessary, restrict contact between people. It's not heartless. Letting it run rampant through the community and devastate our older population, and some of our younger population, would be heartless. During such a crisis, I would be concerned with things other than whether I can go to Starbucks or Kmart for things I don't need.

I would say that neither Australia nor NZ got it right the first time. In fact, the only countries that came close to a perfect response were South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. They had *targeted* measures. They shut down only certain regions, with effective ring-fencing. What's more, they used mobile phone data to track people's movements and notify the public of this.

The blanket shutdowns in Australia, whilst not that strict compared to those in other countries, were not a smart response. It devastated regional economies where the was no virus ever, and it just let it spread through the suburbs of the bigger cities *more slowly*, and eventually it fizzled out by May (except in Melbourne). Back in March, they knew which places were hotspots (Bondi, Mq Park and Penrith in NSW, for instance), yet they failed to take targeted action. If they had ring-fenced those suburbs (no-one gets in or out for a week or two only) and conducted a testing blitz, it would have been a shorter, sharper lockdown, and other parts of the country could have carried on with lighter restrictions.

My previously 50-60 min commute to work in peak hour traffic is now 32 mins (the only good thing that has happened) because the roads are empty, it's eerie.

We've had stage 3 restrictions since the end of March, with the exception of a couple weeks where restrictions were eased prior to this second outbreak. I previously went to gym 5 times a week. We had like a 2 week window when gyms re-opened, which means I've been able to go to the gym 5 times since April (i didn't get straight back into 5 days a week when they re-opened briefly) This may not seem like a big deal, but when exercise is a big part of your life and routine, it does have an effect.

My kids have had barely any school based learning this year. They are 13 and 14 and haven't seen friends in months. Our local football club is a huge part of our community, so many kids NEED that outlet, that connection to community and that physical activity and we've lost all sport. 

We can only travel within a 5k radius for shopping. We don't have an Aldi in our area...and many people rely on doing the bulk of their shopping at Aldi because it is way more affordable. Since we have a Coles and Woolies we have to shop there now, and trust me that effects the weekly budget a lot. You don't realise how much you take for granted just being able to go out and get what you need. We are stuck home so you think - let's work on the garden! Oh right, no Bunnings in 5ks - order online, pay $20 delivery and wait 5 days to get what you need. Nothing is simple or easy, we can't just go get stuff. 

We can't see our family. My mother in law lives alone in Ballarat, haven't seen her in 6 months. Can't travel there. My husband's best friend, a mate who is like a brother to him is getting married in QLD in Oct - can't go. Who cares we lost money on accom - it's missing the event. 

My work is still open but my job was customer service and being a P.A to the manager. Manager stood down without pay in April, then resigned. So I have worked alone since then. It was ok at first because we still had people coming in . Last few weeks I've sat alone at work, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week - no phonecalls, no visitors, no human contact and nothing to do. It's lonely and demoralising. And I am one of the lucky ones because I still have a job.

My family is 4 people but if we want to go for a walk, get some fresh air and a little sunshine (when the sun is actually out) we can't go together. It's all these little things that add up. And it's gone on longer here than anywhere else. The first round of stage 3 was manageable because we could imagine the end of it, now it is so much harder and a lot of us are really starting to feel the mental health effects of it. 

So yeah! In melbourne, we are nothing close to living life as normal unfortunately and I think after this there will be ""new normal"" rather than going back to how things were.

 I live regional.  My nearest aldi is 17 km away. 
If stage four ends up in regional VIC I'll be at the food bank every week because i **cannot** afford Woolworth's. I already had to use it once and that was demoralising enough.

I am just worried that people aren't wearing masks properly down there, and they don't seem to go to pains to make sure that they are at least 1.5 meters away from each other (from pictures and video I have seen from various media online).

Just curious: Has the Government down there put any ads on TV advising how to properly apply and wear face masks - from an Epidemiologist?

Just putting a face mask on seems to give people around me a false assumption that they can come right up to me (within 1.5 meters) and have a conversation or wait behind me to be served etc...

I'm just worried about the WRONG advice being given to people.

I stand by my comments before though that if people wore masks properly and social-distanced properly, everyone would get back to normal much sooner... in around 3 years compared to 15 years, that is. ;-)",1.0,2020-08-17 23:35:03,132.0

"There has definitely been stuff in the news/media about wearing face masks properly...but prior to stage 4 when it was just ""mandatory masks"" I had people come in to my work, and I saw people doing things like just pulling up the fabric of their roll-neck jumper and using that to cover their face....or people using like a chenille scarf that they had wrapped around their neck (for warmth but knitted in a pattern with huge holes) and kind of haphazardly pulling that up over their face where it was loose and half hanging down. People will always be morons.

With stage 4 now there is less people out and about so you see less of that stuff, and most people I see are wearing surgical style masks. Social distancing is still a problem - I have put tables up in front of my reception desk to create the correct distance and have had people move the tables so they can walk right up to the counter. I had a man try to hand me his mobile phone to use to speak to his boss - no way am I touching or putting someone's phone near my face. A lot of people seem ignorant about stuff like that. Even the use of hand sanitiser is sometimes an issue.

Apart from having nil trust in the Govt to keep any of the safeguards it promised in the longterm considering how it has lied about this in the past and allowed supposedly secure data to be accessed by bodies which it said couldn't, Amazon holding the primary data server when several Australian companies jumped through the security hoops in order to be considered and none of them were even contacted, there is the matter of saying they'd release the open source code straight away, now its weeks and will be a restricted release, plus not telling the public about ID tracing duration, amongst other issues:

*TraceTogether's whitepaper recommends ""the issuance of daily batches of TempIDs,"" which are their equivalent of UniqueIDs. These are recommended to change every 15 minutes. So, based on TraceTogether's whitepaper, we believe that the app downloads a day's worth of TempIDs (presumably 96 of them) and uses a new one every 15 minutes.*

*The Australian app instead downloads a new UniqueID only every two hours. It has no batch capacity, so if it cannot reconnect to the Internet within two hours it simply keeps using the same UniqueID. This has serious privacy implications that are not adequately addressed in the PIA.*

"> The difference between 15 minutes' and 2 hours' worth of tracking opportunities is substantial. Suppose for example that the person has a home tracking device such as a Google home mini or Amazon Alexa, or even a cheap Bluetooth-enabled IoT device, which records the person's UniqueID at home before they leave. Then consider that if the person goes to a shopping mall or other public space, every device that cooperates with their home device can share the information about where they went.

> Although it may seem innocuous, the exact phone model of a person's contacts could be extremely revealing information. Suppose for example that a person wishes to understand whether another person whose phone they have access to has visited some particular mutual acquaintance. The controlling person could read the (plaintext) logs of COVIDSafe and detect whether the phone models matched their hypothesis. This becomes even easier if there are multiple people at the same meeting. This sort of group re-identification could be possible in any situation in which one person had control over another's phone. Although not very useful for suggesting a particular identity, it would be very valuable in confirming or refuting a theory of having met with a particular person.

> In addition, the open broadcasting of the make and model of the phone presents a number of privacy and safety concerns. The open nature of the broadcast allows anyone to write an app that listens for and records the information. As such, other apps can listen to and retrieve the data. There could be a number of uses of such information. For example, a thief could use the information to determine who has a high value phone worth stealing. Obviously, this is unlikely to happen in the short term, but cannot be discounted as a possibility.

> By way of an example of how tracking could work, assume an organisation has Bluetooth scanners situated throughout a shopping centre. If there is only one device with a particular make and model in the shopping centre, then that device can be tracked across the entire shopping centre, since the make and model will act as unique ID in that context. Even if there are multiple devices with same make and model, they will still be able to be tracked whilst in non-overlapping sensor zones. They will even be able to be tracked within the same zone, provided that the Encrypted ID is not updated at exactly the same time on both devices. As such, it is likely that even devices with the same make and model will be liable to individual tracking over a much larger area and greater time than was intended in the Bluetooth standard.",2.0,2020-05-05 01:31:28,141.0

You only have to be with range of an infected person's exhaled breath to get infected (the virus still reproduces inside you until it has multiplied enough to overwhelm your immune system).

"Most of the stuff you've read about face masks, saying that they ONLY protect other people is WRONG.

That's NOT the reason that Dr Wu Lien Teh (a Malaysian, born in 1879) invented them in the first place.

He developed surgical masks he had seen in use in the West into more substantial masks (which used layers of cotton and gauze) during a pneumonic plague in China in 1910 to protect the wearer FROM getting infected. These masks went on to become what is known as the N95 mask today.

Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Lien-teh

He lived to the ripe old age of 80 and died in 1960 so he must have done something right!

The N95 masks DO help to absorb water droplets and vapour that otherwise may get into someone else's open wound, lungs, or nose - but being told that this is the ONLY thing that they do is A LIE.

An N95 face masks is also only useful if worn properly. If an article doesn't mention anything about a fitting and breathing test (where NO exhaled air escapes any part of the mask around your face) then IT IS WRONG.

Professor Seto Wing Hong shows in a less-than-2-minute video clip here how to wear one properly:

The app itself will never tell you if you've been exposed. You'll receive a phone call from a human working as a contact tracer.

Although... if we had 100% compliance... if every phone of every person was tracking contacts... and if every person who got infected agreed to share those contacts... the lack of a phone call would be a good indication that you probably hadn't been exposed.

Its also what ""flat flat flat no second wave at all"" looks like, and that's more likely.

At the start of lockdown we had no tests. We now have tests. We had grave fears that the hospitals could cope. We've proven that they can cope with small numbers, and that we can contain the spread of the disease by going into lockdown. We had shortages of basic PPE. There are still shortages of some consumer supplies but hospitals have got PPE and stores everywhere have put up plastic barriers. If there is a surge in cases, we've proven that the majority of Australians can be trusted to go into lockdown and social-distance, and unlike the Benighted States of America all our major political parties, including the PM, are taking the pandemic seriously. Literally every level of government, federal state and local, are listening to the experts, not Twitter, and we have the political will to act if things get worse.

We got the infection rate below 1 and we can do it again if we need to, but I doubt we will need to go into full-blown lock-down again.

"> covid19 virus is something that crossed the line by combining high death rates, long cultivation period and high infectiousness

We still don't have a really clear idea of any of those, since we don't know how many people caught it and didn't either get sick or pass it on. But best estimates at the moment are something like a 0.1% mortality rate, compared to 35% for MERS, 10% for SARS, 10-20% for the 1918 Spanish flu (a misnomer because it actually originated in the USA), and just 0.01% for seasonal flu. As we gain more information about asymptomatic cases, the death rate will probably go down.

The infectiousness is higher than MERS (which apparently is not easily transmissible from person to person), probably about the same as SARS or the seasonal flu, but much lower than the 1918 flu, which infected one in three people in the world. So we were very lucky, this could have been much much worse.

> There are dozens of diseases in the list but none of them can do the same.

**Every single flu** could do the same. A really bad influenza like the 1918 flu could make Covid-19 look like a walk in the park. In some places, *nine out of ten people got sick*.

Ebola has something like 100% death rate in the absence of medical treatment and 90% with treatment. The only reason it has a fairly low infectiousness is that it is only transmitted by bodily fluids, except for one outbreak in a laboratory where it mutated to an airborne strain and started infecting monkeys in cages across the room. That is *terrifying* and the people involved probably still have nightmares about it. A disease like Ebola with measles' infectiousness could easily end civilisation or lead to the virtual extinction of the human race.

Our best bet isn't to stay locked up, it's to maintain excellent hygiene standards and social distancing.

Unfortunately it seems ScoMo and his cronies don't have good empathy skills so once they began getting questioned the got defensive, vindictive and coercive because that's the only technique they have. It would have been so easy to actually apply some empathy and address the public's concerns. Say that the data will only be held by dhhs and not shared with law enforcement other than for quarantine check ups, that it won't be admissible in court, that it will be deleted every 30 days or 60 days.

"I agree - my first thought when I heard about it was ""that's a great idea"" followed immediately by ""no fucking way I'm trusting our government with that though""
Given their track record on any of these issues, whether it's privacy laws and data or abuses of power, I have zero faith that I can trust them to do the right thing. And aside from that, I don't trust them with data full stop. Look st the fiascos with the online healthcare records, or Medicare numbers being sold on the darknet. Or the recent hacks into ANU. So no, I don't buy any of their lines about how we can trust them, and how we need to step up. I'd be more than willing to if they got their shit up to par, and even tried winding back the police overreach (or even just making them accountable FFS) Strip searching kids, the attitude towards peaceful protests, overuse of physical force. It wasn't that long ago when some guy had his neck snapped over a noise complaint - and that's far from the only incident like that.

To top it off, that attitude of 'you better do it, or we'll make you' does not foster trust in the slightest. The one good thing I've heard is that they've agreed to make the code open source, but unfortunately that doesn't do much to fix the rest of the issues I have with how our government *could* use this, or simply fail to protect our data.

There are a few more niggles I have with the entire thing, but they're a bit more tangential than the glaring issues of privacy and abuse of power

Edit: I'd prefer to see advice for the general public to wear masks, even homemade masks if we do not have enough surgical masks (which I don't think we do) and better support for people who need to take time off work when they are sick. We need a huge change in attitude towards both of those, and a lot of people still feel forced to go to work even when they think it's just a sniffle (and often even when it's full blown flu) I am glad to see a lot more people wearing masks out in public, just last week my mum was verbally abused and coughed on in the supermarket for wearing a mask (not even a surgical mask, a fabric N99 mask she bought for the bushfire smoke) She's a nurse with chronic health issues, and she was close to a panic attack after that incident.

As for the government already tracking people, here's [my earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusAustralia/comments/g3k50o/if_you_dont_want_a_tracking_app_how_else_do_you/fns1qhj/?context=1) about that.",2.0,2020-04-18 11:45:44,158.0

"Thanks for your answer. I'm not going to follow this up: there are some arguments that I know are a waste of time, even before I start. 

But, I'm still waiting for people to provide a practical alternative to the app, so that an infected person's contacts can be quickly traced, to keep a lid on any potential coronavirus outbreak. 

I'm getting a lot of ""gov'ment is bad"" responses, but no real answers to my actual question: what should we do instead of this app? (Well... there has been [*one* sensible answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusAustralia/comments/g3k50o/if_you_dont_want_a_tracking_app_how_else_do_you/fnrw7la/) so far.

"That's not really so much of an issue here. Well at least not in my local hospital. Maybe 10 people have ended up in ICU and the majority of people who test positive are sent home to self isolate. But yes it's probably been a problem in NSW but that's sorta mostly due to the cruise ship issue. If a hospital bed shortage happens the plans are already in place to address them. 

But please consider this; if we haven't seen a mass infectious spread through the retail workers exposed to the general public working the grocery stores,  or the tradesmen who are working still and going to multiple job sites in a week,  or the FIFO workers still travelling through airports,  or from the sporting events that happened before they shutdown,  or when people from overseas ( the main cause of infections along with the cruise ships) were going straight into the public before the potential spread from them was acknowledged and controlled or the healthcare workers highly exposed treating those who have been infected it's very likely not going to happen. 

It's not like lockdown will just cease over night. A lot of the measures in place will continue for a while. International travel won't happen for a long time yet, pubs/clubs/restaurants/cafes/entertainment return to business with new operating regulations. Moving education to more digital platforms is possibly the beginning of a new era in education. Having the increased security measures at the shops will probably stay in place because some crazy things were happening in shopping centres before the pandemic.

Govvie needs to foot the bill to tourism industry,
If they dont do this then their overhead bill for this will be about 20x higher at least as entire country will crash.
Dont be worried or afraid or panic, just realize that the transmission for this is aerosols, not droplets or sneezing. So it is airborne, theres no way to avoid it unless your wearing a face mask gloves and eye protection and not getting stuck in closed spaces with others.
Thats why masks are like wearing a condom in HIV intercourse.

It seems like WA has the smartest states premier - dosnt even bother doing tv live broadcasting of their media releases.
Theres no point it only fuels a small % of population that want borders open when in reality if we get swamped from this and hospitals cant cope the death rate will match USA's death rate of %. 
I Think it was around 1 in 100 to now 5%. 
What this means is that 1 in 20 people you know could die and the other 8 will suffer from permanent lung and vascular damage that dosnt select based on age who it effects.

So lets pay the tourism industry sufficient $ to cover their bills, enforce the banks to hold out on tourism owners runners employees to freeze their mortgages loans etc etc.

Lets get the country back on its feet form the use of face masks as it is aerosols and airborne and DOES work, close the borders again, IDK about you but I can see a way out of this but we have less than 4 days to take action before its to late and it will snowball and every state but WA will have this.

We have had a very low fatality rate in the world and the new outbreak in VIC had it even lower.

"Realistically, all borders need to be closed untill all cases are eradicated (could be months now), which we as an entire country actually had a few weeks ago!

Have you noticed the news is finally starting to talk about what ive been saying for the last 3 months.

We dont need to cripple the economy, we dont need to have 20% of our population on job keeper. We just needed to not compromise communities with the opening of borders.
We need this to run its course and limit in its community transmission zone, and thats it. If it means greater Sydney then so be it, it just reinforces the use of PPE. Holidays can wait until were safe - or we can choose to allow everything open and we all loose our jobs and benefits of freedom = (another total lock down)

If the country wanted to be extra precautions they also needed to keep any bars clubs pubs closed, restraints are ok if enough distance. But i fear that from what im saying the situation will get worse because the above steps have not been taken.

Personally my advice for you if you need to use public TSPRT is: 
Wear a cloth mask underneath a kn95 mask (2 masks). Wear sunnies, eye protection or reading glasses to limit eye exposure. sit near a window or door opening so you get fresh air every 5-10 minutes of door opening and wear disposable gloves when on public tsprt. And maybe listen to radiohead ; P if thats where your name comes from.

Remember that medical staff in New York were able to sustain working in a covid infested environment (ED) for up to 12 weeks with out contracting the virus so we can as well.

Also remember that the virus is transferred via air / aerosoles meaning its not just a sneeze or cough like the common flu. This is highly transmittable. So think about how aerosoles move, watch a few videos on how they linger in the air for and when settling how long they last in an environment when they settle.

I would wash my hands or use hand sanitizer when ever you feel the need without being ocd about it. And spending some time in the sun could help a small fraction because UV does kill this thing, just dont over expose.

We are not immune to this thing but there are within the capabilities of protecting ourselves probably up to 95% with the right steps. that enough is able to eradicate this thing.

Maybe get a red t-shirt made with print saying ASYMPTOMATIC on front and back. It is a joke but also a statement that this entire country needs - realistically we could all be asymptomatic, and we need to act like it.  You know how they say only wear a mask when showing signs and symptoms, but by that state you have allready infected 20+ people min, so currently most health advice given on the news is wayy off. If you want to know whats really happening and how cautions we need to be watch international news and then youll get a gist of what we need to do to stop this.

I hope it helps and hasnt been to long for you.

"I just read the article and honeslty....I totally agree with a comment above that its all just farts üòÇ

Its just sounds like its blaming WHO that it hasnt given out a good enough warning about airborne transmission yadayada. I personally dont think this would be robust evidence given that there has been numerous countries who are spending paramount of effort and money  researching the virus hasnt figured out its airborne???
Wasnt there already information about how long the virus stays in the air even though its large droplets also on surfaces???? So thats why I am still perplexed as to why people are still against protective masks and gloves etc. 

Ppl in China are all demanded to be wearing masks as advised by their chief health officer also recommended to wear gloves, goggles because of airborne transmission and because of the nature of the virus. They were hit hard first in Wuhan, lost so many lives. Probably more than the reported numbers. Looking at USA, their fucked over. If China have given out advice like that and a full lockdown to control it - its like an example already given how many lives lost and now the success in containment of it but other countries are like still debating whether masks should be used at this stage of the virus while its spreading and waiting for WHO????? what are our scientists and other scientist or health professionals doing with the research with COVID??????? 

Edit: I always think preventative is better tham reactive - even though there may be not enough evidence on the effectiveness of masks which may be true as we dont have pandemics every year to research on it, thank goodness. However there's contradicting statements from our government since the start of their management of this virus. Masks no masks? Lockdown no lockdown? Full lockdown or no full lockdown?

"Australians will face restrictions on hosting social gatherings in their own homes and more workplaces will be forced to close as the nation moves towards a British-style shutdown that could last months.

In an escalation of shutdown measures discussed by national cabinet on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders were preparing for the next stage of the coronavirus pandemic, which would see only essential services operate and residents largely confined to their homes.


The new restrictions come after an elite team of academics quietly recruited by the federal government to help develop Australia's social distancing strategy recommended an immediate, hardline and costly lockdown to boost the chances of a quick national recovery once the COVID-19 crisis ends.

Urging a ""go now, go hard, go smart"" strategy that would shut down schools, the expert group advised Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy an estimated 20 to 30 per cent of Australians would not comply with the measures and strengthened public communication was needed.
The final advice from 22 eminent specialists from the Group of Eight research universities, seen by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, endorsed a major escalation, urging Australia to seize a ""short and vital window"" and introduce ""strong, immediate and co-ordinated social distancing measures, accompanied by an enhanced COVID-19 testing regime"" to be sustained in the long term.

Mr Hunt began preparing the public for the tougher measures on Tuesday after the first stage of shutdowns was enacted over the weekend. He warned the banning of all pubs, clubs and gyms was ""not the last stage, and I think I should be very upfront and honest about that"".


Australian cases topped 2000 by Wednesday, after doubling in less than three days, particularly in NSW and Victoria. An eighth Australian died of the virus on Tuesday after contracting it on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney last week.

""The general direction, obviously, is about people spending more time at home, obviously keeping the distance,"" Mr Hunt said. ""House parties, they're out, let me be absolutely clear on that.""

The measures are likely to see restrictions on barbecues, dinner parties and birthdays. One option being considered is restricting private gatherings to 10 people or less.

""Above all else, people don't need to wait,"" Mr Hunt said. ""If you can take steps to spend time at home, do that.""

The national cabinet is expected to establish a nationally consistent approach on the definition of essential services on Tuesday night. The move will help define which businesses must close and those that can remain open.

The advice from the leading academics across epidemiology, infectious diseases, biosecurity, law, computational modelling, mental health and emergency response was requested by Professor Murphy last week and sent to Mr Hunt on Sunday in the midst of an extraordinary split between the federal government and NSW and Victoria, with the states agitating for a more hardline crackdown.

It backed a rapid rollout of measures that would include ""more extensive banning of mass gatherings, school closure or class dismissal"".

""While the stronger measures recommended increase the upfront cost of action, there is evidence that it increases the likelihood of a speedier move to a national social and economic recovery phase,"" the group advised.


""Interventions need to be comprehensive and simultaneous to have the most impact ‚Äì a slow trickle of interventions, or suburb-by-suburb lockdowns likely will not be adequate.""

Mr Morrison on Sunday flagged that suburbs could be isolated and locked down one by one as the crisis escalated.

A minority of experts in the group had argued for a localised and phased approach to school closures and other interventions, based on the particular spread of COVID-19 in different areas. They highlighted the benefits of keeping schools open, including managing children's social distancing and hygiene. That position is closer to the one adopted by the Morrison government so far.


Members of the high-powered academic group included Melbourne University dean of medicine Shitij Kapur, biosecurity professor Raina MacIntyre, bioethics professor Angus Dawson, clinical epidemiologist Tracy Merlin, computational modeller Nic Geard, environmental epidemiologist Jane Heyworth, Australian National University dean of medicine Russell Gruen, quarantine history specialist Alison Bashford and legal academic Terry Carney.

The experts also recommended the government urgently roll out a ""much-enhanced and co-ordinated regime of COVID-19 testing"" that would include community testing to estimate the rates of disease in the population.

On Monday, Mr Hunt said 135,000 tests had been conducted in Australia and a further 1.5 million kits had been ordered. The scale of testing has been constrained by the short supply of kits. Universities are also developing testing methods.",9.0,2020-03-24 09:09:38,195.0

"You‚Äôre not overreacting. Arguably everyone‚Äôs a few weeks behind the virus, by the time the numbers get really scary and our hospitals stop coping it‚Äôll be too late. If your friend was taking the public health crisis seriously they probably should‚Äôve cancelled their birthday celebrations. I had a friend who had to postpone their wedding and her hen‚Äôs (which I was already planning not to go to).

I know it‚Äôs hard to internalise how severe this is because about a week and a half ago I was also one of those clueless people thinking that the virus was only a bit more lethal than the flu. But the problem is that‚Äôs the wrong thing to focus on. I‚Äôm sure everyone here knows the maths but it‚Äôs about making sure our healthcare system can cope - and on current trajectory (20% growth rate in cases each day), with the number of ICU beds in Australia (around 2200), and the estimated proportion of people who need intensive care (5% of cases, according to Chinese research), Australia will run out of ICU beds by mid April, and that‚Äôs assuming that no one else needs intensive care other than coronavirus patients. (Reference: http://theconversation.com/how-well-avoid-australias-hospitals-being-crippled-by-coronavirus-133920).

That‚Äôs why I wish ScoMo would just start the lockdown - we know it‚Äôs going to happen sooner or later, and by now it‚Äôs probably already a bit too late. People are still going out because the Government hasn‚Äôt explicitly told them not to.

That should have been the end of it but his mum didn't take the hint, and despite everything thinks that this is appropriate. üò≥ My husband caved, I didn't want to fight over it so I said fine as long as she respects our requests. 

She is trying, which I appreciate with keeping her distance, but I don't think she's aware of her actions.

It wouldn't be at all intentional for most of people, and I'm not perfect but I am trying hard to be aware of my actions and hygiene.

I made a comment that this would be the last we see of either of our families for a while and she asked what if my parents (who live closer and spend more time with our son) asked to come over. She seemed shocked that I said no they wouldn't be, we've already discussed, it's more so for their own good as they're in their late 50's. Maybe now the penny's dropped that I'm not mucking around.

"I understand your frustration and can't believe the lack of understanding some people have here. 

My sister is currently stuck in Bogota, Colombia and has no idea when she will be able to return to Australia.

When the government first put out the call for Australian's to come home, Colombia was already in nationwide lockdown with all borders closed and all air travel shut down. 

Between now and then, humanitarian flights have been offered to the US however notice for these flights are usually only about 5 days. For someone who has a lease, a job and a life in another city, it is not possible to make a decision to leave with only 5 days notice and there was still no guarantee that they would be able to get to Australia upon arrival in the US.

Her partner had a partner visa approved for Australia last year and a condition of the visa was that he access by August 15 2020. Given the fact that the borders are closed and there a no flights, they went around in circles trying to get someone to provide them certainty that the visa would still be valid. Eventually, all they were told was to contact DFAT only after they had plans to travel to Australia, upon which a letter of facilitation MAY be provided. They paid nearly $8,000 for this visa.

Based on this advice, in July they decided to book a flight to Australia with LATAM for 2nd September when the Colombian airport was expected to open. My sister and her partner both gave notice for their jobs, started packing up and ended the lease on their apartment. 

Since then, with the introduction of the arrivals cap in Australia their LATAM flight has been cancelled. They can only get travel credits and the only available bookings to Australia are in January 2021. 

My sister now has no job. Luckily her partner was able to keep his job and they have been able to keep their apartment. 

Even if they had the money to write off the $3000 with Latam and book with another airline, the Colombian airport is not opening to international travel as originally planned. There are humanitarian flights to the US still but because of the demand to get flights to Australia, this still isn't an option for them and they will likely end up stranded in the US and having to spend a total of $15,000 to get home. For a couple who have been earning Colombian wages for the past 2 years this is equivalent to 4 months earnings.

This cap on the number of Australian citizens allowed to return to their home country is ruining people financially and mentally. Not to mention the fact that they are still just having to hope that the visa will remain valid...

2. It was literally impossible to call through to the airport to book. The websites were crashing constantly. 
3. There were travel bans being put into place literally day by day. If we booked a ticket that had a layover, there was a huge risk we would be stuck in a layover country, maybe even just stuck in the airport. We saw heaps of people fighting with staff while transiting because they were being denied flights.

Everyone in Australia was just saying 'just come home' and even now people are like why couldn't you just come home earlier.
Turkey organised like dozens of private chartered flights to get their people home. 
All Australia provided was Gladys 'chronic bitch face' Berejiklian nagging us telling us to come home.

A sport event is important of course, it is a place to release stress and to some its what they their lives mean. And it's especially important when it's an international game like the Olympics.

Do NOT take chances on a virus like this, when it's highly spreadable by ways that no one is 100% sure of. We might think we are fine and just want to have some fun, but ask ourselves a question: IF I end up getting the virus and spread it to people around me, my loved ones, will I regret it? 

If one can spread to many, we add stress to our already overwhelmed medical system, more people will be left without treatments, which will only cause further stress to the economy and your favourite entertainment may be gone for longer than you want.

The App should have been programmed to swap numbers with ANY person that passes within range of you, over a 30 day period, and WITHOUT waiting for ""15 minutes"" of exposure to do so...

It DOES NOT take 15 minutes of breathing in the exhaled air from someone around you (who is infected) until you catch it yourself. Anyone who honestly believes that rubbish needs to have another think about it.

A viral load, however small, only needs a host (ie: your lungs or anywhere inside your body) to then replicate. When the virus has replicated enough to overwhelm your immune system, only then do you start showing symptoms.

Scary thing: This can take anywhere from a few hours or a couple of days, right up to 27 DAYS. However long the virus takes in your body to replicate enough to start making you sick.

First, notice that I said where strangers are 1) in proximity and 2) for ages. *Not* your quoted grocery shopping example a (which borders on strawman).

Situations like: 

* Commuting by public transport (30min+)

* Waiting rooms (45min+) that aren‚Äôt enforcing distancing. (I haven‚Äôt yet been in one that blocks off enough seats to ensure a 1.5m gap.)

* Tradies inside your home, (or pest control, cleaners), especially where they bring anonymous subcontractors. 

* Naive/irresponsible family forcing non-dominant members (eg teen kids) to attend celebrations with Aunt Karen who‚Äôs a pandemic nightmare.

* Workers in prolonged-contact jobs like receptionists of dentists/GPs, carers (disability/aged), dentists, etc. 

* Parents having to pack into a small zone (impossible to  distance) each day to pickup younger kids who aren‚Äôt safe to walk farther from the chokepoint by themselves. 

* Long train journeys (eg 7hr Perth to Kalgoorlie) 
...

So you took your phone with you, knowing you‚Äôre going into a dodgy situation. Fuck me, at 0.0005% chance of it,  the app later alerts you, and you notice it coincides with that at-risk situation. 

*Knowing that it was a high-risk environment*, I damn well isolate immediately, avoiding vulnerable family members, and phone my doctor and the hotline. And stay isolated until after getting test results. (I actually did this hardcore already, not imaginary ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do.‚Äù.)

That's not how the app works. How it works is that ten days after you went to the IGA, the government messages everyone with the app who was there at the same time as Joe Bloggs who tested positive yesterday, so that you can upload your contact data to the government so they can find out who you've been near. By the time you get the message, its too late: you're either infected, or you aren't.

The app isn't an early warning system. It isn't like an anti-Covid-19 radar that pings you when you get close to someone sick. It can only tell you that you might have been somewhere near to someone who may or may not have been infectious but has come down sick since.

> And maybe get tested after the fourth day‚Äôs ping in the same location.

And that's not how testing works either. You have to have a significant viral load for it to show up on the test, the test tells you if you are infected^1 now, it doesn't tell you if you have been exposed to the virus and might get infected.

In the mean time, since children are the least likely to die from the disease it is ideal that they are the ones who get infected.

""This important epidemiological report confirms that children contract COVID-19 infection and that the vast majority have mild or moderate, even asymptomatic, disease. It also shows that infants are at the highest risk for severe disease. These findings should heighten our urgency to protect patients by urging families to adhere to public health recommendations for social distancing and careful hand hygiene.

"I would suggest talking/writing to the approved provider of your service and get other Educators on board if you can. If they are not the type to listen to health reasons, go for monetary reasons such as:

The government is paying them 50% of the earnings that they made prior to the pandemic. On top of that, the government will be paying the majority of their wages. At a VERY conservative estimate, staff wages take up 70% of income, so unless you have more than 20% of that income going to staff who have been employed for less than a year, then overall the centre is getting back 100% of what they made before the pandemic.

Yes, if you earn enough you can apply to the government for more money, but it's not guaranteed and you won't necessarily make enough to make it worth it. Therefore it is more profitable at the moment to reduce spending wherever possible by reducing the number of children attending the service. 

It's also worth considering that some of the wording of these new policies are still vague. To get the JobKeeper funding you have to have lost 30% of your revenue or more, but some of the wording has the potential to indicate that this will be evaluated each month. So if your revenue jumps back up to normal this month, next month you will not receive that funding.

We also do have restrictions, depending on your state, that say that you may only leave the house to access childcare if you have no other reasonable option. In which case your approved provider should not be creating a place where families can break this law.

If you can turn these points into a well worded letter or discussion, whichever you are better at, you can potentially convince them to change policy to only currently accepting families who do not have at least one parent staying home.

I don‚Äôt know what sums you are doing but models I‚Äôve seen indicate a peak in May/June - or since we have done so well at flattening the curve even possibly July. Yes the tail goes for quite a while, but we are looking at it mostly being over this year (for the first wave of infections anyway. More complex once you take into account that corona viruses mutate. Hopefully we have a vaccine before the second wave, or more likely something to minimise symptoms).

If we get infections to 0 we are just delaying the inevitable & hoping for a vaccine. Being closed off from the rest of the world as they slowly build immunity isn‚Äôt as smart a strategy as you think. It puts us in a really vulnerable situation where we may have to do this all over again (repeatedly).

Either way, we don‚Äôt get a choice, our government has made the plan, communicated it and is acting exactly as predicted to get the results it is after. Community transmission is growing slowly, we are down to an R of close to 0.5 which is fantastic as we won‚Äôt even max out ICU beds at this rate.

Originally I would have liked to have gone for the eradication method like NZ... but I do see that mitigating the virus and slowing it down as much as possible is a good solution in case a vaccine never comes, or is so far away and not as effective as we would like that we are just delaying the inevitable & will run the risk of importing the virus anyway while staying closed off from the rest of the world.

Also don't let the media's reporting on one or two stories of people coping racial abuse scare you, and in the same breath, if you read the comments, there's a lot of non-Asian Australians who express their disgust in some of the actions of these inbreds. 

At the same time, some Asians have done shit that's quite appalling in the interest of their own safety above everyone else's (like hording items - there was a report of 10K face masks being stolen from the Hospital, that person has been charged and I would not be surprised if she was an Asian). So there's that side of the coin too.

Personally, I question some of the shit that certain Chinese people do (I am Chinese myself). I point my fingers to these individuals and not generalise everyone as a whole. Just like the association with terrorism and Islam. Not All Islamic believers are terrorists, and not all terrorists are Islamic believers, same with Nationalistic Extremism (or whatever its called, Right left, Centre, Up Down, doesn't matter), I blame those specific individuals. There's a difference here and I think a lot of people share this logic.

I always feel more secured, self-confident  and less guilty when reading the supporting comments You all have posted in online forums like Reddit.

But some of the comments and verbal abuse I suffered in the street and public places in the past, some masked as jokes and some downright insulting have made me acquire this belief.

I believe it is a combination of both, my perennial inferiority complex and the current situation and many news stories and videos  I watched online recently has aggravated in me that perception that Australian people's generosity and acceptance of Asians like me has changed. That somehow the majority population's generosity and tolerance towards Asians have reached an end. And as an Asian I am *prima facie* at fault (even for being existing) and have to carry the stigma of collective guilt by association.

It might not be a fair system, but we don't have a say in it unfortunately.  I'm really trying to put it nicely, but I can't sorry. I'm hopeful that with the measures being put in place were not going to reach Italy and China levels and our health care can support the sick we have. Again hopeful.  If a lockdown happens soon or we all start to pull kids from school we can hopefully make this happen. 

I personally have taken my children out of school and self isolated from public/family starting today. It might be an overkill to some, but it's worth it to me to avoid any risk, even if its low. I certainly don't trust a stranger to do the right thing unfortunately. 

People who aren't freaking out and worried sick like some of us, are most likely blessed with healthy children / elderly parents or being naive. I'm hoping that they do the right thing and self isolated to stop the spread but I can't guarantee on it so I'll lower the risk on my own.",7.0,2020-03-16 08:36:52,223.0

"I'll have a crack. Keep in mind, I think we SHOULD be in a proper lockdown, but I'll explain it as I believe the gov position to be:

Most of our current cases have been imported from other countries, either Aussies coming home or others coming here, both planes and cruises included. Community transmission is still very low. This is why we saw a fast rise in cases (people coming home with the virus) and now a bit of a decline in new cases (most already home, those left overseas finding it difficult to get back). It's also why we are putting them in hotels now, and have been asking them to self isolate for the last 2 weeks. This will heavily stem the issue of importing spreaders.

While community transmission is low, business needs to continue operating as long as is feasible (and then recommence as soon as possible) in order to pay for the economic damage being done by previous measures like hospitality, gyms, etc being closed to slow the spread as well future measures (stage 3, 4). Make no mistake, we will be paying this stuff off for YEARS already, without even considering what further damage future lockdowns might cause. We will absolutely see a recession, and likely IMO, a prolonged depression where almost all asset classes will see a heavy devaluation and jobs will be hard to come by. Times will be desperate. More so than most people can imagine. Many small and large businesses will close and never reopen on the other side. That is unavoidable at this point and it's impact on society WILL be dire. It's quite possible that the impact from that will be worse than the virus itself, in both economic and human life measures.

The gov are betting that by enforcing the social distancing, closing places/businesses/events where spreading is likely and isolating imported cases, protecting the most vulnerable (elderly) as well as keeping the ""more essential"" businesses moving, we can stave off community transmission increases that would inundate hospitals and possibly even totally avoid a 1000+ death situation, as well as avoid a ""total lockdown"" which would destroy our economy, and keep the taxpayers and tax paying businesses ticking enough to pay for it all. It's easy to demand a lockdown to save people. It's harder to do the ""right"" level of lockdown without creating a problem worse than what we are facing to begin with. The reward for nailing this strategy is that we would come out less economically affected than other countries as well as less affected in terms of deaths from the virus. If it doesn't work, a lockdown can be done at the point at which community transmission reaches a level that that keeping the remaining businesses open is no longer an option.

There's also the possibility that a total lockdown is done, destroying the economy and then we go back to work only for it to flare up again almost immediately, putting us in the position of having a COMPLETELY dead economy, no taxes coming in, assets worth zero and starting again with battling the virus. You don't want to be in that position.

The whole thing is a juggling game. Each thing you do to stop the virus, hurts the economy. If you don't do enough, the virus will be worse. There needs to be a ""balance"". As much as I dislike Scomo, I don't think he's doing a terrible job. He's certainly taking a bit of a risk by betting that he can beat community transmission, but if he pulls it off, we will come out at the end of all of this better off than almost any other nation.",56.0,2020-03-29 05:45:56,229.0

In the case with USA, population size and density again plays a factor, which is why NYC is hit the hardest. In addition, you have higher domestic travel within the USA given the numerous locations. Also, our medical system is far superior than USA's. A month ago, I was reading in the Coronavirus subreddit that USA had done very little testing, inaccurate testing, not enough testing kits, lack of medical facilities to get them ready.

Our gov't is quick to bailout corporations--time to make sure we regular people are all protected. We have the exactly wrong person in office, but must be placing pressure on everyone to create safety for us. So get calling and writing your council, members, leaders. Get your coworkers and neighbors and family to. Because without that pressure, we are not going to be alright;  these leaders will bailout airlines and give cash to their corporate friends, and leave us hanging--again. In the meantime, for your mental health, google ""anxiety breathing"" and google ""grounding exercises"". These are incredible to stop anxiety, which leaves us paralyzed and useless and more at risk of getting sick ourselves. Breathe deeply, stop reading the news, get exercise (walking a safe distance outside, away  from others), reduce booze intake if you partake, get sleep, eat healthy foods, and realize you are right to be anxious--don't let these a-holes in office give all the money that should be helping us, to the rich,  this time.

Your describing anxious thoughts and your describing the physical response to anxiety. What I would say is that you are doing something that is called catastrophising, which can be really overwhelming and can make you feel stuck. 
One of the most important things is to acknowledge that this is a totally normal response to what is happening right now in your life.

A few tips- sit down and actually write down your concerns, the what if‚Äôs etc. Then make a list of things you can do to counter that list. Allow your self some *worry* time, sometimes that can be helpful to know that you can‚Äôt ignore it, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be a constant all day thing.

The things you can do- take all the safety precautions you can, talk to your employer about whether there‚Äôs any other measures that would be good to implement to assist in making you feel safe.
There is also an amazing amount of researchers putting out free resources online. Happy to share if you feel it would be helpful. I‚Äôd also recommend the headspace app- I use it all the time to help guide my breathing when I feel overwhelmed.

"I think you are in the right track... supermarkets have opened an hour early in most places to allow the elderly & disabled to shop.

I would point out too though if your mother works in health care she has a high chance of catching it. You don‚Äôt want to then pass it on to the most vulnerable section of the community through well intentioned actions. Maybe this isn‚Äôt the job for you?

"I am someone in this category- I am disabled and usually rely on home help. I have had to cancel all the support workers coming to my home and get by as best I can due to the virus as I will die if I catch it (I am only 29 but have a severe chronic illness- thank you for remembering the disabled are vulnerable as well). I think one of the hardest things will be getting essential medication as getting a delivery from a pharmacy isn't a simple process and it's the last place you want to be as a vulnerable person in a pandemic because it is where sick people will gather. I think if you can help people with this that would be great. Also, for safe disinfecting, if you place the medicines on the ground just outside the person's door when you are delivering it and spray with a mix of household bleach in a 1:100 solution- enough to keep it wet for 2 minutes then that should kill the virus (make sure you turn it to get all sides with a freshly gloved hand. Then have them collect that after a few minutes once it is dry. Also mix the bleach and water fresh each day and store the bleach in a cool dark place so it doesn't degrade. If there's important dosage information on there that might be damaged by bleach+water, stick a piece of clear packing tape over that before disinfecting and just leave it on permanently.

&#x200B;

You can also talk to the pharmacies and see whether they offer a prescription on file service where they can home deliver medicines for people, and if some elderly people need help understanding the service maybe you could explain it to them and support them to use it? I would recommend doing that by dropping your phone number off in people's mail boxes though, not exchanging it face to face, and definitely not talking to them face to face.

"Do you mean no profits for the banks or no profits for landlords seems like a good outcome?

Anyone with a property negative geared, which will be a lot of landlords, will not be making a profit at the end of the year if they lose their jobs. The only way they make a profit, or break even, is if they can deduct the interest off the tax they pay. If they pay less or no tax then there goes their profit.

Now, if their tenant doesn‚Äôt pay rent they still have to cover that payment, where do they get that money from? Even if they freeze interest payments they would have to be made up later and they compound daily.

Even if landlords don‚Äôt want to evict tenants, or aren‚Äôt allowed to, banks still can. If landlords can‚Äôt pay and the property is repossessed then the tenant is evicted by the bank. 

No landlord would want to evict a good tenant, especially if they are having hard times. Of course they want to do all they can, but if it comes down to their family eating or their tenants you will struggle to find anyone that wouldn‚Äôt choose their own family IMO.

Many landlords aren‚Äôt rich corporations, they are everyday people who work damn hard and save so they could get a second property, and they hope that it will help them in retirement. In coming times those properties are going to be worth significantly less now, so that sucks for them too.

So they've said that if someone in your household has an infection it will not change the behaviour of other people in the household in terms of how you interact with people outside your household... Would be interested to see it remodelled with that changed as it could be a significant variable.

>*the only tangible benefit of school closures, coupled with case isolation, is in delaying the epidemic peak by two weeks, at the expense of a slight increase in the contribution of children to the incidence peak.*  

This is interesting. Seems that the governments logic on schools could be okay?

&#x200B;

>The 90% SD compliance practically controls the disease, bringing both incidence and prevalence to very low numbers of isolated cases. It is possible for the epidemic to spring back to significant levels even under this level of compliance, as the remaining sporadic cases indicate a potential for endemic conditions. We do not quantify these subsequent waves, as they develop beyond the immediately relevant time horizon.  
Nevertheless, **we do share the concerns expressed by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team: ‚ÄúThe more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity‚Äù** 

So it sounds like even with 90% there's risk that it'll become a lockdown - release - grow - lockdown - release - grow cycles endlessly until we get a vaccine. I do wonder if we're just delaying the inevitable here. If 20% of people between the first cycle and the second cycle decide it is not feasible, we'll end up in the 70% scenario anyway.

It's difficult too say but most people generally sorta agree with the approach of being pretty hardline on borders and what not. It will mess alot of things up in the long run like tourism, regional markets, produce and production as well as other sectors. But from what I have heard even overseas like in Europe tourism businesses are going bust with lack of tourism and increasing debts and costs ect 

I don't think the border will re open until mid next year or so, but even then when it opens it will be really selective with certain countries, and possibly even with mandatory hotel quarantine at first, which would put alot of people off travelling I imagine.

Lastly I and most people think the government have done a really good job overall. Most people no matter what side of the political spectrum you float on generally think that too.

"I'm sorry that you're separated from your partner - it's a really difficult time. I hope you guys are okay.

I think the Federal and State Governments are doing alright, considering. Taiwan and New Zealand have shown what can be achieved if a country takes early advantage of being an island, and I think a lot of the population here envies their numbers. We'd rather be NZ than Germany, I guess, and that still seems like it could be achievable. The NT, WA and Tassie are pretty close to it.

In terms of the economic impact, much of the world is facing down a recession, too, at least if we irradicated COVID here we could get on with as much of our lives as we could afford. Public opinion might change on that in another year though, who knows.

I suppose the issue with relying on the quarantine measures is that:
* A proportion of Australians couldn't/can't be trusted to self-isolate properly on arriving back in the country, or after they test positive. (I'm not saying that you wouldn't, don't get me wrong!)
* Enforcing that isolation - by either in quarantining them in a hotel, or I guess a form of home supervision - requires resources. The State and Federal Government are already shelling out a lot of additional money and this is an area where they can limit their expenditure by limiting the number of people allowed back in, and making them pay for their own hotel stay.
* The current outbreak in Victoria and the growing number of cases in NSW can be traced back to the system failing in Victoria. 

So basically - it's already not entirely effective and it's expensive to enforce, and loosening up the rules to allow more people won't improve its performance.",1.0,2020-08-11 04:55:37,238.0

People will attempt to utilize the government to solve every possible problem they can think of, no matter how effective or ineffective it is, over solving problems themselves. 

The concept of freedom is dead here. If you can barely even go outside, exist anywhere in public without a mask no matter if you're 100 meters away from another person, and so on, I don't think you have any sort of chance anytime soon of getting in. All you have to ask yourself is doing X making me less safe or more? Australians will choose the latter option 100% of the time absent any real thought about it. Whether any of it's effective or not, whether Sweden model of not giving a fuck is better, only time will tell but I'm pretty sure Australia would do the exact same thing because people just want to have control or at least pretend they have control over accepting things that they cant, just like in every other aspect of Australian culture.",-12.0,2020-08-10 11:18:23,238.0

That said, the overall global stat appears to be 50% of those that go into ICU die and even that stat is too fresh because there are still many of the 50% in ICU that have not recovered yet. If they end up on a ventilator, the outcome is as high as 70% fatality but that is not a causal link to ventilators, it simply means that they were sick enough to have to be put on a ventilator.

The simple answer is that we don't have enough information. If you are asking about Boris, he has a number of pre existing conditions, age, weight, childhood pneumonia, and apparently asthma. The last video of him certainly looked like he was having difficulty breathing. But this is probably mostly true for any Covid admission to ICU, so drawing a conclusion about Boris is a little premature.",9.0,2020-04-06 23:37:38,241.0

* Excluding these, countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of \~0.5% (South Korea) to 0.9% (rest of China).
* Countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between \~3%-5%
* (paste)

If those who die make it into intensive care if they can, then we are looking at for a prepared country, approx 10%-20% of people dying once they go into ICU. For an overwhelmed health system, nearly all of the people who need ICU but can't get it will die.

Nobody stopped her from protesting. There's plenty of ways she could have amplified her voice that didn't require mass maskless gatherings.

"> When you organise an event that has the potential to cost peoples their lives, what do you think is a reasonable reaction to that?

And so what about people who organize a music festival, where someone might perhaps overdose and die?  Or where, as a result of traffic coming to the festival, there is a traffic accident and someone dies?

We generally dont arrest people for doing things that could ""hypothetically be dangerous"".

I suppose you might make a comparison to carrying a weapon, or driving dangerously.  

The difference is those are demonstrably dangerous.  If 50 people get together there is a *very* high chance *that nobody has Coronavirus*.  In that case, they present *zero* danger.

Like walking down the street with something that looks like it *could* have been a gun, but is not.  There is no danger, because it was not a gun, and not dangerous.

So .. if you want ... get cops down to the protest, test everybody, and *then* if someone turns out positive you can move forward with saying that they were engaging in some kind of dangerous activity.

But if you are going to arrest people because what they are going to do in the future *might* be dangerous, then you can arrest someone because you think thy *might* drive dangerously the next time they get in a car.",0.0,2020-09-04 10:58:57,247.0

I'm Canadian.  And from my perspective you Aussies have just gone totally round the bend on this Covid paranoia stuff.  It hurts me to see things like this arrest.  I know it might seem justified to you if you believe things like ""contact equals spread"".

BUT COVID IS NOT ANTHRAX OR THE PLAGUE ..

Did you know that if you *live* with somebody, you only have a roughly 20% chance to pass Covid on to them?

If they are your *spouse*, that number goes up to about 25%.

So if that is the chance of transmission to somebody you *share a bed with*, what do you think the chance of transmission is when you stand near someone for a while outside?

Did you know that if you are under 60 years old you have less than a 1% chance of death from Covid?

Did you know that even if you are 80yrs and over and you get Covid, you have a 4 in 5 chance of *not requiring hospitalization*?

I dont know what news you guys are watching, or what stories you are telling each other, but it seems to me you have a very exaggerated estimation of the nature of this virus somehow.

You want to see proof of what I say, right?  No problem.

Oxford Academic - [Characteristics of Household Transmission of COVID-19](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa450/5821281)

>Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% compared with 17.1% for adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% compared with 16.9% for contacts without quarantined index patients. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% compared with 17.3% for other adult members in the households.

The Lancet Journal of Infectious Disease - [Household secondary attack rate of COVID-19](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20\)30471-0/fulltext)

>the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts was 12¬∑4% (95% CI 9¬∑8‚Äì15¬∑4) when household contacts were defined on the basis of close relatives and 17¬∑1% (13¬∑3‚Äì21¬∑8) when household contacts were defined on the basis of residential address

WebMD - [COVID-19 & Household Spread: How Likely?](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200430/covid-19-household-spread-how-likely)

>His team estimates that more than 19% of people in the same household as a COVID-19 patient, or nearly 1 in 5, can expect to develop the infection. An estimated 14% of close contacts who aren't in the same household but see the patient regularly will also develop the infection themselves

. . . 

[""What are my chances of needing hospitalization or dying if I get Covid, according to the CDC?""](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm)

0 - 19yrs old = 0.1% hospital, near 0% death.  
20 - 29 = 1% hospital, near 0% death  
30 - 39 = 3.4% hospital, near 0% death  
40 - 49 = 4.3% hospital, 0.2% death  
50 - 59 = 8.2% hospital, 0.6% death  
60 - 69 = 11.8% hospital, 1.8% death  
70 - 79 = 16% hospital, 4.3% death  
80 - 89 = 18.4% hospital, 7.8% death  

89% of the people who do require hospitalization from Covid have underlying conditions.

The most common were high blood pressure (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%).

Takeaways -

- Covid only seriously affects a small portion of people who get it, from ""almost none"" at the young ages, to ""1 in 20"" when you are in your 40s, to ""1 in 5"" when you are in your 80s.

- If you are in that small group of seriously affected people, it is most likely because you have health issues and you are more vulnerable to things. Although there is a very very slim chance that if you are in that group even though you dont have health issues.

- Unhealthy people suffer more severely from various diseases and illnesses, healthy people suffer less. This is not strange.

- Fatality rate only hits 1% when you are over 60.

- 4 out of every 5 seniors over 80yrs old who get Covid dont need to go to the hospital for it.",1.0,2020-09-04 12:06:25,247.0

"In my opinion there are a few key differences here. Firstly everything that we give to private companies is done with our full knowledge and consent, they legally cannot surreptitiously collect more than they say they will. Secondly it is less likely that the data one gives to a private, offshore company will have any legal consequences for that person now or in the future, but information given directly to the government could be used in any number of ways.

Or to discredit political opponents during an election? Or to blackmail or otherwise silence journalists and whistle blowers? A private corporation cannot do any of that

"Firstly, there are many ways to limit the data you send to those examples, ranging from being mindful of what you post/search to using virtual machines.  Some of the people arguing against the covid app would be very familiar with online privacy and safety.

That being said, using these things all the time, every time you connect to the internet, is bloody hard, time-consuming, and only really accessible for people who know what they're doing.

This is exactly what i was trying to communicate. I specifically said LESS likely. 76% is 24% LESS than 100%. With an offshore company the government has to request the info and show cause to get it.

Well what other options are there?  You either interpret the data yourself or you rely on someone else.

Realistically those are the only two options.

"Vaccine discovering and implementation raises the specter of logistical challenges and vaccine deniers.  Vaccination rates will determine eradication, thus any denier will risk everyone of reinfection just like measles/chicken pox.  The choice then becomes access to schools or workspaces if you are/are not vaccinated.  This debate will go on as per current denier rates, or prophetically more given the conspiracy rates in the population.

My caveat is that the virus mutating as per other viruses will risk ongoing shutdowns and/or hygiene ritualisation of normal behaviour.  Remember even if you get vaccinated you can still get a virus again as there may be minute changes in RNA and/or idiosyncratic immune response person to person.

The other options may be redistribution of populations to low density housing and permanent work from home for some industries.  On an extreme level there are quarantine zones like gated communities within city/states.

While the problem is obviously that at the moment, without a vaccine, we would blow past these numbers immediately if we removed the restrictions, but at some point, once we have a vaccine, we will need to accept that there is going to be a baseline infection rate, that we ARE going to be able to deal with.",1.0,2020-07-24 07:16:47,266.0

I think this is rather sensationalist. They seem to think that there is something different about this virus that it will never go away. SARS was eradicated, without a vaccine, and was a whisker away from becoming a pandemic, and is a close cousin of COVID-19. The problem is this one is more infectious and seems to have a higher amount of pre-symptomatic transmission. The key is testing. If we can produce and carry out tests on an industrial scale, it will make getting rid of this thing a lot easier. There are already rapid tests out there that can deliver results in half an hour. If everyone in populated areas gets tested routinely, say every two weeks, that would surely be a game-changer.

"I don't know because I've never been to the UK, but I'll hazard a guess.

 Here in Aus, the state Premiers led the way. Andrews broke ranks and closed the schools early while Morrison was still talking about going to the footy. And the feds have been pushing as hard as they could to ease restrictions, but the states told them to shove it and kept restrictions in place.

The effective social isolation measures introduced by the states meant that Australia's health system was never put under pressure. Every person got the care they needed.

In the UK, they had BJ blundering about, deliberately obfuscating the message while trying to keep isolation measures to a minimum. They have recently just opened up the pubs again, despite having hundreds of new cases every day. 

The lack of effective social isolation measures meant that the NHS was put under pressure and the medical professionals had to pick and choose who to treat, which meant that not everyone got the standard of care they needed.",2.0,2020-07-11 04:50:03,267.0

"What the mainstream media ISN'T telling anyone is that it DOES affect the young! (By young, I mean teens to 30 year olds.)

Sure, they might get it and survive it, but the mainstream media AREN'T showing people what horrible DAMAGE their bodies are left with AFTER they get Covid-19.

You don't have to be fat or diabetic; even fit and healthy and sports-active people who recover get the following:

Lung damage (20% to 30% loss of function), heart wall muscle damage, liver damage, kidney damage, dizziness from walking up or down stairs or around the block, prolonged loss of taste and smell... and these effects last for MONTHS.

Around two-thirds of people who have ""recovered"" from Covid-19 (even after 90+ days) STILL can't return to work full time because they are still suffering effects!

"Basically I spent over a decade with bronchitis, always on the verge of pneumonia, viral illness would send me over the edge. 

I was never able to get it under control until I started treating the mast cell aspect/aka very allergic type person aspect. 

It's probably worth trying some antihistamines. H1/h2 antagonists zyrtec/zantac ended my last bout of pneumonia. Like shit you not. 

When antibiotics and prednisone were only buying me a few days before hospital...zyrtec unblocked my face and zantac unblocked my lungs 

Unfortunately there's a nationwide shortage of h2 antagonists since zantacs been taken off market (before covid)...so you'd need a script for ranitadine (which is still zantac! And has a carcinogenic ingredient in it so it's really only something I'd recommend to stave off pneumonia)...the replacements for zantac still are not stocked.

"Hi there! Psychiatry doctor here.

Seems like you might be suffering from some pretty bad anxiety there... I wonder if from your description, it‚Äôs been in the background for a little bit but with all these new stresses it‚Äôs becoming unmanageable.

The main thing I would recommend would be to see your GP and ask for a mental health care plan so you can see a psychologist (the care plan is so that it‚Äôs paid for by the government). The psychologist will be able to give you some good strategies about how to manage your stress, improve your concentration, help you challenge your worries. Depending on the school, school counsellor could help with this too.

Unfortunately this might take a little bit of time to organise so there are some things you can do in the meantime.

Sometimes simple breathing exercises can help you ‚Äúreset‚Äù a little bit and take the edge off the stress, so you can stop the spiral of anxious thoughts. One good app for this is Reachout Breathe https://au.reachout.com/tools-and-apps/reachout-breathe

Some people find progressive muscle relaxation another helpful way to take a few moments to break away from the stress and worry. Many different videos guiding you through how to do this can be found by searching ‚Äúprogressive muscle relaxation‚Äù on Youtube.

One simple strategy some people find helpful is to designate ‚Äúworry time‚Äù. This is where you spend 15 minutes a day writing down absolutely everything you‚Äôre worried about and then afterwards you‚Äôre not allowed to worry anymore - you can remind yourself that there‚Äôs no need to worry about it anymore, because you‚Äôve already done all the worrying you can and already worried about everything. If you start to worry about something, you can also remind yourself that it‚Äôs not your worry time, and you can worry about it later at the designated time. There is also an app for this https://au.reachout.com/tools-and-apps/reachout-worrytime

One really good resource is also the kids helpline, which you can either call or do online chat (and it‚Äôs not just for kids either, it‚Äôs for young people up to age 25!). This could be particularly helpful for you to just have a chat with someone that isn‚Äôt family, friends, or a teacher, about how you‚Äôre feeling and how things are really difficult for you right now.

Here's how I get through it. 
I channel that stress and negative energy into doing  things, keeping busy at work doing monotonous work etc. When I study I try really hard to just focus on what I am doing and nothing else for that time. Taking breaks regularly.
Sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed particularly at work. So I have a little cry in the car or a moment here or there and go back in and do my best to help people.
So my advice is to keep everything as simple as you can, plan your day to do everything sequentially and focus on the task at hand. If it gets hard then have a break and let it out.

Yep. Teacher here. The actions regarding schools has not been about the welfare of students and staff, nor about the purpose of schools (student learning). It's been about squeezing everything possible out of the workforce and the economy.

This week just 0.25% of the school population attended, unable to source care elsewhere.

However, unless there is a lockdown, teachers after the ~~holidays~~ break (at my school) need to attend school to deliver online lessons.

If you are vulnerable- quit. Otherwise, yes, you will get the virus, it will pass around the school, and you will be part of Australia that has immunity when the second wave hits. That‚Äôs part of the plan.

Our principal told us all to work from home for those last few days of term, although we were welcome to come in if we needed to, but we needed to let him know for numbers.

So it doesn't have to be by their normal classroom teacher. Basically, the school needs to provide enough staff onsite for a 1:8 ratio of students to teachers, to supervise those students, and no more than 10 students to a room.

If we do not build up herd immunity slowly (not even sure if thats possible now given the new research coming out) what does this mean for Australia? Does it mean we stay in lock down for how ever long it takes to make a vaccine? does it mean our borders remain shut to international visitors until the vaccine?

I think we need to start rolling restrictions back on a national level soon though, we don't need to go totally back to how it was previously, but we need to start moving around domestically again. Long term, as in people moving freely around internationally again, I don't see how that can happen. It's a worry, but I guess we cross that bridge when we get to it.

"Pretty low unless we do something *incredibly* stupid like allowing international travel again. (Sorry mate, you're stuck in Modor for a while yet.)

Where is it going to come from? There is not likely to be a large undetected reservoir of the virus out in the community, unless the virus is both a lot more infectious and a lot less dangerous than we think.

And if that is the case, then much of the country has already had it and we've heading toward herd immunity. (Some theoretical models from the UK suggested that could be the case. The biggest support for this model is that there is some evidence that Covid-19 had already hit the UK as far back as January, and nobody noticed.)

*Of course* there will be a minor uptick in cases when restrictions are relaxed, but with care it shouldn't be a dangerous surge. We should expect a series of two steps forward, one step back as lockdown is relaxed, but I expect the steps backwards to be small unless we're dumb and unlucky.

I'm glad that *I personally* don't have to make the decision when to start relaxing lock-down. It's a hard decision: too early, and we could see a surge in cases. Too late, and not only are you harming people's lives unnecessarily, but you risk community backlash.",1.0,2020-04-25 01:37:44,309.0

We still don't have a safe or effective SARS or MERS vaccine, and Covid-19 is from the same family of coronaviruses. The SARS epidemic burned itself out; the MERS pandemic is technically still running after eight years, not that anyone would notice. (Human to human transmission of MERS is quite low.)

A couple of months ago I had to get a Hep-B vaccine, and I didn't hesitate a second, so please don't mistake me for some sort of knuckle-dragging anti-vaxer when I say that I will not be volunteering to take any first generation Covid-19 vaccine, especially not when it is rushed out with far fewer trials and less testing than normal.

"The benefit of how hard we've flattened the curve is that if new research reveals that herd immunity isn't possible, or there's other long term health implications or a vaccine isn't possible that we still have eradication as an option. Countries that have let it rip a bit more have less options available to them as we learn more.

If it turns out that herd immunity is the way to go then we can still get there quickly, it's not like this is hard to spread and with our increased hospital capacity we can go harder. We would also have more information on how to hit the right numbers and how to treat patients to improve the outcomes. I don' think this is likely to be the best strategy but we haven't ruled it out as an option for us.

Right now we're keeping our options open and our population alive.

What I've learnt in the last two months being able to get news from China, Japan, US and here in AU, is that many governments put economy before human lives. It may be ok for them when it was JUST a flu, or just a known disease with limited contamination. But this is something new and NO ONE, even till now, can figure out what exactly it was, where exactly it's from, the only thing we know, is that it spreads super quick, indiscriminately.

China researcher had found the virus consisted characteristics of AIDS which was unlikely to have formed within animals , so this tells us the virus is very tricky and unpredictable, no quick fix, and it's just NOT a flu!

Putting our political differences aside, look at people around us that we interact on a daily basis, if this turns bad when we decided to do nothing, then these people are gonna get sick or even die from it and we will regret not taking precautions and not tell them to do the same!

Our government has hesitation, mostly because of financial stress, which we should give them some understandings, but while saying that, if we can't change the governments, then we should still do our bit to make sure our communities are as ready as we can. Look out for one another, and don't judge them if they fall sick.

"While it is true China was covering it likely trying to prevent economic damage and public panic that doesn't mean that they ignored it or took no action.

Hubei forced hospital isation, welded people into their apartments to isolate. They built 14 hospitals in 2 months.

This is from first case on November 17 and   mid December it was at concerning numbers by mid January is extreme measures. So about 2 and a bit months for an emerging virus.

Australia has known about it pretty much since since December and has known exactly what we are dealing with but the government has done nothing.

The standing of the US in the rest of the world has been poor for a while now, with the last few years exemplifying this. 

Everyone's just been watching the situation in the US like a train wreck in slow motion. With terrible health care, lots of poverty, and poor social safety nets the situation in the US is going to be horrible. We knew it was going to happen when COVID-19 started to seriously spread. 

I'm reasonably happy with how Australia has responded now, with lots of testing and the now lockdown. But lots more could still be done. It seems in comparison the US has done almost fuck all until it was too late, and now the cat's out the bag.

US citizens have so much national pride believing they are the greatest country in the world.

The news don't mind pointing out our own response is working relatively well (it should have been better, but the govt have plenty of bad to compare themselves with and pat themselves on the back about, and the media lines up to report it). 

We got our first case a within a few of days of the US and have closer ties to China and much of the region around it (both economically and in terms of immigration), nationally we have similar levels of obesity and slightly worse issues with asthma than the US so we should be expected to have similar infection and death rates, but we have a tiny fraction of the cases per million population and and even tinier fraction of deaths per million population, and that gap is increasing - our new infections and deaths numbers have been decreasing while the US numbers soar. The main differences seem to have been the responses of the state and federal governments (in particular, more timely and better coordinated responses - more testing, earlier lockdowns, etc); in some cases a week or so too slow and with several fuckups along the way, but still basically listening to the experts and not persistently undermining them.

> Do you have a significantly changed view of the United States and its standing in the world?

Not at all, if it wasn't already pretty clear before, since November 2016 it's become increasingly plain that a large section of the US is completely divorced from reality and literally nothing that happens there surprises me at all any more. There doesn't seem to be any low which the country will not happily lower itself to, and then seek to go even further. I don't see anything changing any time soon.

"To be honest I am getting lots of my news about how badly America is handling their slow motion car crash from American based online sources, which I was doing before anyway because ever since Donald Trump was elected my father and I have considered American politics to be a soap opera with ugly actors. 

When I check Australian media the overseas Coronavirus news gives more emphasis to Italy and Spain although now New York has gotten to the stage of temporary morgues and crowded hospitals it‚Äôs getting more attention. A lot of the overseas news news focuses on which countries have locked down, Australians trying to get out of locked down countries and cruise ships. 

No, my opinion of if the USA and it‚Äôs standing in the world has not changed significantly. It was low with occasional flashes of utter contempt before Coronavirus and American leadership reacted with the same partisan stubbornness, incompetence and terrible health care I have come to expect of the Trump administration and Republicans. It was inevitable considering how he has systematically driven away everyone competent. America is always going to be treated with respect and politeness because of all the trade we do and their army but I do hope their standing in the world is lowered dramatically in the aftermath of the devastation, partly out of spite for how they keep bragging about American Exceptionalism and being so great and partly because I am tired of our government sending our soldiers along blindly every bloody time America decides to start another bloody war in the Middle East. 

While initially I was displeased with the slowness of the response and feel Morrison initially didn‚Äôt take it seriously, prioritised the economy over health and should have shut down schools way sooner, I have liked him more recently and he was able to realise the seriousness of this far more quickly than American politicians and pivot fast enough to make a difference. 

One thing I have noticed in this crisis is how much more easily Australian politicians are to let go of ideology than Americans. The Liberal party has always been obsessed with a budget surplus and cutting social security. I would not have believed the amounts, the high raises and the payments the Liberals are pouring into Centrelink and other businesses a month ago. The free childcare for workers is astonishing for them. And the Opposition are not protesting or fighting the Government on sheer principle either. This is not happening in America. Partisan differences and politicians refusing to support Coronavirus measures for unrelated ideological reasons are still there. 

Also our states and federal government are getting on way better. America they are practically at war. In Australia it is more the states listen politely as the Federal government explains what they think should happen, then say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice. This is what we are going to do instead.‚Äù Federal government watches them walking off and silently and sulkily follows after a minute, still offering aid, not holding grudges and enforcing the things everyone agrees is Federal responsibility.",6.0,2020-04-04 09:10:46,347.0

I'll be coming from a country with less cases than Australia (at the moment) and I'm actually more worried about picking up the virus on the plane or in quarantine.

Compulsory quarantine was not always going to be a thing.  We went with self quarantine for months.  If it had worked we would not have had any local cases.

"Once again I never said anywhere that Australia won't get a serious outbreak, didn't even slightly imply it. 

And we are different, it's a scientific fact, we are on the other side of the planet in a completely different region of the world and this has to be considered if we are thinking scientifically, and to not consider it opens you up to misguided judgement and false conclusions (like the conclusion our cases would mirror Sweden's with similar restrictions) 

I believe our winter is the largest threat to us right now and I think a large outbreak is a very real threat in Australia, as I said before we don't have conclusive scientific data telling us how this virus reacts to the seasons, it could have totally no effect, or it could be similar to influenza. We simply do not know. We don't even have a conclusive reason as to why the flu is more contagious in winter, only theories. 

For all we know this virus could have a very hard time in the off season and go ballistic in the flu season just like influenza. We simply don't know if that is the case right now as we haven't had the chance to study it. If this is the case we are in for a rough flu season.

I think direct comparisons with other countries should be taken with a very large grain of salt. Especially those on the other side of the world.

Hypothetical situation here:
For example let's imagine influenza A just popped up out of wuhan never before seen virus, started devastating countries all over (as no one has immunity to this new illness). It rips through countries in their colder months and seems to be under control in Australia. Australia naturally odes their success to good lockdowns and case tracing. They begin to ease restrictions going into winter... Massive outbreaks.

I'm saying presume we're not somehow the exception to the rule because it's safer.

Scenario 2: We are ordered to download the App or not get paid wages / unemployment benefits until we do. Still, some people resist and the lockdown lasts longer.

Scenario 3. Finally, after several weeks wasted due to the previous scenarios not being done by everybody, we then finally do this. But in the meantime, countless lives are lost.

Then after 3 weeks, with the numbers of infected and dead spiraling out of control, I realised that they actually did the right thing. Sounds weird, I know.

The thing is: There were people who were floughting the stay inside orders, infecting others and causing needless more infections and deaths, and if these people were put in jail then more infections and deaths would follow especially from prison guards spreading it to their families.

So, if some people won't stay at home (and I know that most are doing the right thing), then others will see them outside and think ""That's not fair - why can't I do that too?"". Then they will get sick of being cooped up and go outside unnecessarily.

"Ebola vaccine:

- given to a few tens of thousands of people at **immediate** risk of getting a disease with an average fatality rate of 50% fatal that often leaves survivors with long-lasting health effects.

Proposed Covid-19 vaccine:

- planned to be given as a precautionary measure to hundreds of millions of people to prevent a disease that is mild in 90% of cases and a mostly kills the elderly with pre-existing complications.

Vaccines can be [dangerous and deadly](https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fxtu9v/what_are_the_current_barriers_to_pushing_out_a/fmwhbc6/) without years of careful testing and clinical trials.

We still don't have a safe and effective SARS or MERS vaccine, and Covid-19 is from the same family of coronaviruses. The SARS epidemic burned itself out; the MERS epidemic is technically still running after eight years, not that anyone would notice.

Scott Morrison has recently announced free childcare. Our center (like many others) had a lot of kids taken out due to their parents concern about infection. After last Friday, the phone was ringing off the hook with parents ready to send their kids back to the center.

On Monday, we have 15 toddlers enrolled. The Monday before, we had 8. Our room is not very big so 15 kids will be crammed in with 4 Staff. (This is just the Toddler room.) There is also an Infant room, and a 4-5 year old room. Toddlers sneeze and cough on each other and staff. They put all of the toys in their mouths. They drink each others drink bottles. They hardly ever wash their hands, or even understand its importance. Most parents send their children into childcare even when they're sick. This is all ok when we're going through a standard winter. But we're not. We're experiencing a infectious viral pandemic and there is no cure.

I'm sure the experts have access to better information than just the state totals, but it would be interesting to see if cases of local transmission are on an exponential curve - from a low base - under the larger and subsiding curve from the travellers.

If yes, it means our current actions are insufficient and we'll have a lull of maybe a few weeks before exponential growth gets us into larger numbers and we have to go tighter.

If no, it means our current actions are sufficient and we'll have a lull of maybe a few weeks until the experts are confident that local transmission is under control and they'll start backing off the restrictions in areas of lower risk.

ACT has also announced they are doing community testing to detect any unknown hotspots.

If there was a large pool of community transmission, I'm actually fairly confident it would be found relatively soon.

Also, if there was continued community transmission, even completely undiagnosed, the 3% or so who die will still show up dead, and the 20% or so who need hospital would also show up in the health care system.  Apparently COVID-19 is clearly different to the flu (that's what triggered the Chinese doctors to report it in the first place, after all), so if a number of people were in hospital but untested I'm sure the doctors would get them tested asap.

The breath tests developed by Israel, South Africa, and Australia (University of Tasmania) are FAR more accurate.

For sure. The dirty secret at the moment is that we have really don't have much idea how nasty the virus is so that will change any model and policy response. The appropriate policy response differs between a virus with an IFR of 0.1% (a slightly worse seasonal flu), 2% (something that we haven't seen in 100 years) and 0.5% (a fairly normal, slightly more contagious pandemic flu).

"With a massive increase in reported chilblain cases, doctors are certain there is 'something going on'

18th August 2020 By [Carmel Sparke](https://www.ausdoc.com.au/author/carmel-sparke)

Australian doctors are raising concerns about an ""unheard¬†of"" high number of chilblains in patients¬†they suspect may be related to undiagnosed COVID-19 infections.¬†¬†

Sydney GP Dr Bruce Solomon says he normally sees chilblains once every 5-10 years.

He was therefore surprised when, after discussion with his colleague Dr Anna Lindsay, they realised ¬†six cases had ¬†presented to the Rose Bay Medical Centre in the past few weeks.¬†

Since the pandemic started, international researchers and doctors have described in the medical literature 'COVID-toes'¬†‚Äî¬†or [**chilblain-like skin issues in patients who have tested positive**](https://www.ausdoc.com.au/news/doctors-suggest-possible-cause-covid-toe).

They've also reported an upsurge in numbers of chilblains in children¬†who were negative for COVID-19.¬†

Dr Solomon says all the patients in his practice who had chilblains, including a teenage boy, tested negative for the virus.

But he has strong suspicions the ""unheard of"" upswing in chilblains¬†is a vasculitis, is related to COVID-19¬†and could point towards current tests not being sensitive enough to pick up this type of presentation.¬†

>**""There‚Äôs something going on. This throws up numerous questions about the vasculitis, the sensitivity of the current testing and the actual true prevalence of COVID-19 in the community,‚Äù Dr Solomon told**¬†***6minutes.***

¬†""I think it is something to do with COVID-19, because it (chilblains) is a vasculitis, and COVID-19 can be a vasculitis.

¬†""And if that proves to be true it means that our testing regime is missing some cases.""

**Read more:**¬†[***How does COVID-19 manifest in skin?***](https://www.ausdoc.com.au/specialist-update/how-does-covid19-manifest-skin)

Dr Solomon‚Äôs concerns follow a recent case study in the *Lancet,* with Swiss doctors reporting on the case of an 81-year-old woman who presented with fever and a rash but tested negative for COVID-19.

Six weeks later her condition had improved but a biopsy of her rash was found to have low levels of SARS-CoV-2.¬†

Other Australian doctors and researchers have also noticed a rise in the number of chilblain¬†cases and suggest a possible link between these and COVID-19 in the community.¬†

Melbourne paediatric rheumatologist Dr Jane Munro said¬†in a tweet she's seen ""buckets"" of chilblains referrals this year, often without a history of COVID-19 and with negative swabs for the infection.

""These biopsy results are fascinating,"" she said in relation to the *Lancet* report.

Dr Munro was responding to a series of tweets from Perth epidemiologist Dr Zoe Hyde who has been following the link between COVID-19 and chilblains, including the *Lancet* case report.

At least one other doctor, paediatric orthopaedic surgeon Dr Carrie Kollias said on Twitter she'd seen a similar case in a young patient, who was asymptomatic and also tested negative for COVID-19.¬†

The anecdotal reports highlighted the need for a ‚Äòhub‚Äô that drew¬†on the experience, expertise and practice of doctors around Australia, Dr Solomon told *6minutes.* 

Dr Solomon added he was¬†curious to know if other GPs were¬†seeing similar cases of chilblains.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a resource of thousands of GPs out there, who are very intelligent, with many years of experience. That resource ought to be tapped immediately.‚Äù

That's not what the article says, it says they're not being diagnosed (eg, not tested).  If they're carrying the virus and have a test they **will** test positive. The PCR test is almost 100% accurate with proper sampling.

Cause and effect is a funny thing.

"Some doctors *believe* it may be associated with COVID-19 in patients that are testing negative, so it *may* be the case that the tests are not sensitive enough.

The obvious answer is that it's Winter, and because of COVID-19 people are WFH, and kids aren't outside playing with their mates, so there are people being sedentary in poorly heated homes where they normally wouldn't be. That's not mentioned in the article at all, even though ""being cold and sedentary"" is the primary cause of chilblains.

Hypothesis 1: chilblains are more numerous because more people are in situations where chilblains develop.

Hypothesis 2: chilblains are a previously unrecognised symptom of COVID-19 in patients who have tested negative for COVID-19 because the tests aren't sensitive enough to detect their infection.

"You have said that people are carry the virus but not testing positive, ergo there is no proof they're carrying the virus. That's pure speculation. And the article doesn't describe it as fact as you do.

There's mention of ONE OR TWO cases where patients LATER tested positive (and many more that don't), but we've already seen false positives and that doesn't preclude them picking it up later. 

But the real slam dunk is that most of these cases are occurring where there's no COVID cases at all, so unless these children are picking them up from asymptomatic carriers who transfer the infection to no one that becomes symptomatic it's a mere coincidence.

The article is still *conjecture* and the comments *hearsay*.  And the conclusions you draw from it are unsupported by the evidence.

It's certainly possible they're a symptom of Covid, but because someone has it doesn't mean they have Covid that isn't going to show up in a test as **you** claim.

Many people blame Dan Andrews for the security guard fails in the hotels and I think that is so grossly unfair.

He gave the go ahead to make people stay in quarantine (after being shown people were not quarantining themselves) and is being personally being held responsible. This is a pandemic and if we expect the role of gov to be personally overseeing the training of security we have bigger issues. There are bigger issues and he is busy overseeing more than expecting employees to keep it in their pants and if thats what we are paying him to do, we have no idea how big the job is.

The virus spreads person to person but people are breaking quarantine, requesting exemptions and travelling, not following distancing, etc. Its people. People ourselves are spreading this thing - we know the main way to stop it but its not going to as long people are around other people.

I have seen so many think that just because you can go to someones house, means the 1.5m or other rules dont apply - hugging, sitting close at table, etc. We have been told not to, but it still happens.

Residential towers, hotels, people sharing indoor confined space is also another factor of spread - regardless of the security guards, it could have been done by someone coughing in a lift, which we have seen.

we have just started using quantitative easing - printing money and giving it to the banks to loan cheaply. this is one way of increasing the money supply. 

another way is to give the newly created money directly to people, to spend on things that keep them productive like food and housing, and keep the economy going around. 

the issue with creating new money is inflation, which is why we need tax, not to raise money to spend, but to prevent the value of our money decreasing. there are plenty of suggestions for simple and equitable taxation systems - financial transaction taxes, carbon taxes & flat rate land-owner's tax are good examples. just pick one thing that represents value - income, energy use, land use, and create a universal progressive taxation system around it - makes it easier and fairer for everyone.

No reason to think that is less likely in the country. 

You don‚Äôt need help making the decision, you‚Äôve made it. Just tell them. Focus on point 1 and then set up weekly/daily phone calls so that you guys have contact in case something happens to them (you haven‚Äôt mentioned that as a point, but if they died as a result of this would you have regrets not seeing them one last time? I still think you are making the right call but you do need to acknowledge this *is* possible so you don‚Äôt have massive regrets if it does happen).

...

Also I know you are joking but domestic violence generally rises at any time there is stress or more prolonged contact.

"Thank you, you've made some very pragmatic points. And you're right, I have already made my decision. My boyfriend and I have had cold symptoms for a couple of weeks, and we're self isolating. We will eventually get tested, but at this stage the system is stretched in Sydney - I'd hate to take a test that could have been used by a vulnerable person when my symptoms are only mild, slowing the process of them getting crucial medical care. I hope I'm not being irresponsible here by trying to be responsible... We're waiting to see how our symptoms develop and just avoiding contact with everyone.  
Summing up, it seems to me like the most risk-averse decision is to limit contact with vulnerable people full stop. Good advice on the regular phone calls - weekly/daily contact will be meaningful in mitigating their anxiety. Thank you.

"Thanks for your thoughtful comment. That's the thing, I am much more concerned about them. I read an article today about a young couple who had mild cold symptoms and were refused testing by their GP, and then later were confirmed to have COVID-19. I'm not going to risk visiting them without a negative test, and testing is a slow process at this stage. Good question concerning the medical care where they live, that's been part of my thought process too - it's very good. They live in an area that's basically middle to upper-middle class regional, not a large population, and compared to Sydney, hospitals should be considerably less overwhelmed. That said, it's an area with an ageing population, and as of yesterday night there are 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases there. My parents are separated, but they both live within 10mins drive to the nearest hospital. My mum in particular is very vulnerable, she went through chemo a few years back (she's okay now), so her immune system is very weak. She lives with a boarder who is very supportive, and gets her groceries etc. My dad cares for his elderly mum in a house they share, and I'd consider them both vulnerable (grandma mostly). Thankfully, almost my whole family lives within a 20km radius in that area so there should be lot of support available.

"I only did a year of medical school so not exactly an expert but from what I remember, ""herd immunity"" really only applies to vaccines. In the UK they are just using ""herd immunity"" as a nice way of saying, lets do the minimum and let everyone get it.

The amount of immunity you need to establish for herd immunity relates basic reproduction number (R0) of the virus and with this virus the R0 is quite high. If we say it is similar to Polio with an R0 of 5 to 7, then 80% to 85% would need to get the virus and recover. 

The way to handle contagious viruses has been studied and modeled very well, you must test, track and contain. The surveillance you get from testing is invaluable as you know the path you are on and what stage the outbreak is at. This enables you to use the right strategies to ""flatten the curve"".  

The countries that handled this well have been Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, they acted early and proactively. In the case of Taiwan and Singapore they acted so well early on they have had very few cases. In the case of South Korea they had large numbers infected but tested extremely well and contained things remarkably. 

This ""herd immunity"" bullshit is the exact opposite of what we have seen countries that were successful in combating this Coronavirus do.   

Needless to say, I'm very angry about what is happening both in the UK and Australia, I know here we have very few tests so perhaps trying to play that off as a feature and not a bug is their excuse.

2. Herd immunity is a term from epidemiology and simply means that if the group has a high enough immunity the disease cannot spread enough to sustain a community infection. For measles for example if someone cannot get vaccinated but everyone around them can then they will never be exposed, so their lack of immunity is irrelevant and they survive. As per point 1 though, this virus may not have immunity development as part of the recovery, so this doesn't really apply.

Well, ignorance is bliss, or so they say, and most of us go around being blissfully unconcerned about how close we could be to death every time we get sick.

On the other hand, we are the product of millions of ancestors, every single one who managed to fight off infections from bacteria, viruses, viroids, fungi, amoeba, prions, protozoa and disease-causing parasites of all sizes long enough to have offspring, so we're not exactly helpless in the face of disease either.

By the way: there are seven types of [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) known to infect humans; three are considered very serious (SARS, MERS and this Covid-19 novel coronavirus); the other four are considered mild, and are responsible for about 15% of all common colds.

Every year, we have the risk of serious epidemics. The 1918 flu killed more people than World War One. The flu is not a harmless disease. I know that the US is not Australia, and their healthcare and social systems are barely one step up from a third-world country for the majority, but each year [tens of thousands of people die from influenza](https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year) in the USA (about a 0.1% death rate). In Australia, we have better medical health care and social systems, but it still kills [hundreds of people each year](https://7news.com.au/news/health/flu-deaths-hit-300-as-season-passes-peak-c-209939).

The Commonwealth government monitors [dozens of serious diseases](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdna-casedefinitions.htm) and each year there are anything from a handful to many thousands of cases of each. Covid-19 will just join the list. There is [no shortage of dangerous infectious diseases in Australia](https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/-/media/Files/Corporate/general-documents/Infectious-diseases/PDF/Statewide-ND-rpts/2020/Week-17-statewide-notifiable-disease-report.pdf) but life goes on.

New arrivals can also be asked to wear protective equipment and some venues can ban new arrivals like restaurants/pubs, movie theaters to minimise the risk of an outbreak, and breaking the rules can be treated as a crime.

That's an excellent question, but I don't have a good answer. It depends I guess on which countries people are travelling to and from, whether the epidemic is still running, whether there are accurate tests for Covid-19 exposure, etc.

> noone knows if getting the virus makes you immune.

No-one knows *for sure*, and doctors are playing it extra cautious by saying ""we don't know"", but people's lives are on the line if they get it wrong so it pays to be cautious.

I on the other hand am just some dude on the internet, if I get it wrong people will just downvote me and write a mocking post. So I'm going to stick my head out and say that *almost certainly* people will gain immunity, because [that's how it works for other corona viruses](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/what-do-antibody-tests-for-sars-cov-2-tell-us-about-immunity--67425), most of which seem to keep immunity for 2-3 years, although one study hints that immunity to SARS might last for up to 17 years.

The bottom line here is that the novel corona virus responsible for Covid-19 is deadlier than the flu (except maybe the 1918 strain...) but not as deadly as SARS or MERS; it seems to probably be more infectious than MERS, and we can expect that on the balance of probability people who have been exposed will gain some level of immunity for 2-3 years, probably.

Between social distancing, face masks, temporary (and hopefully short!) lock-downs, and immunity, that should be enough to manage this, just as we have managed SARS (the 2003 pandemic is over) and MERS (technically the pandemic is still happening, but we've never has a case in Australia), neither of which has a vaccine.

Everything points to Covid-19 being managable, even if we don't develop a safe, effective vaccine. We are getting better at keeping people alive if they catch it, and if we are willing to go into short periods of lockdown and continue social distancing and wearing masks in the event of an outbreak, we ought to be able to keep them *local* and avoid the disaster scenario of a total meltdown of the hospital system.",1.0,2020-06-14 15:38:19,438.0

"It will be a choice between keeping borders closed and accepting the associated economic costs, and opening borders and accepting covid deaths.  An easy choice you might think, what's money compared to lives.

The economic cost could be pretty big though.  At the moment in Australia there are about 13m workers supporting a total population of 25m, so 13m workers and 12m economically inactive.  If the workers start leaving but the elderly stay then that ratio gets worse and worse.  The elderly have a lot of money but that doesn't mean so much when there aren't enough workers to actually produce stuff.  They're fine because their labour is suddenly very valuable, but retired people would find their assets become virtually worthless.

Ultimately this will come down to what the elderly prefer.  Would they rather accept the risk of dying from covid and be able to drive round Australia, go on cruises, do the things they want etc, or not have to worry about covid, but be comparatively poor?

"It‚Äôs a pity that other countries buying up Australia are rarely covered in in this debate, China isn‚Äôt the only one and is not even the top dog.
Personally I have no issue with China or globalization, but then I don‚Äôt take much notice of some media twisting of facts, or reporting things completely out of context.
I just wonder why so many jump to attack China, is it from what they read or hear on TV news, YouTube groups, 
I‚Äôve seen a lot of China, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time there, but I don‚Äôt recognize much of what the media says or those who comment negatively.
One consideration before jumping to being anti globalization, or the idea of taking ownership of their investments.
Thousands of small Australian businesses are profitable because of China, often creating jobs, Many businesses that were on the verge of going bust have been reinvigorated and keeping many employed.
Spinoffs of companies which rely on Chinese items for manufacturing, outsource to small and mid sized businesses.
All these businesses and employees buy local products, keeping others employed.

There is another problem with going it alone, Australia‚Äôs economy and population is to small to be able to viably manufacture everything itself. To stay in business a company has to sell, but they also have to make reliable products, the cost of Materials, labor, taxes etc, would make it impossible, 
Farming would collapse, since China will soon have sufficient fruit and veg, milk and meat can be sourced elsewhere, so prices here will skyrocket, 
Mining will drop off, Tourism will drop off, 

So all in all if Australia goes down this path, there will be many out of work, think millions, taxes will need to rise to pay for welfare, 

The only way to perhaps save the economy from this path, would be to lower wages of low and middle incomes to a level that is nearer to poverty than comfortable and even then, the buying power would be to low to stop the slide

There will be minimal exports as other countries will follow this same path,

Plots show total confirmed caseloads of each state, and project how fast they are growing using running one-week models. The growth rates are plotted directly in the right-hand plot. If social distancing is working, we should expect these to start trending downwards over the next 1-2 weeks. We want to be where Singapore/Hong Kong is, not where Italy/USA is.

Graphs will be updated daily with new caseloads. Statistical models are run in R, graphs made using D3.js. Feel free to give me feedback etc.",2.0,2020-03-23 04:37:34,454.0

Often treatment is started rapidly based on a preliminary diagnosis but further tests are performed to establish that diagnosis especially if the patient fails to respond to treatment.

We were never two weeks away from being Italy. Whoever told you that was having you on, or was totally clueless themselves.

Australian government response has been absolutely fantastic so far. Global analysts who look at the figures in other countries are jealous of our response. Not just best in the region, one of the absolute best globally.

">No we were two weeks behind italy on initial infection

No, we never were. Our *reported* cases looked like Italy's *reported* cases two weeks prior. But that was only because Italy was hardly testing anybody unless they went into an ICU with bilateral viral pneumonia. Their *actual* number of cases was probably several times higher. Ours was pretty spot on.

You can see the results in action: Italy setup a super-draconian lockdown on March 9th. Not only schools, all childcare and pre-schools were closed as well (we never did). Still, even two weeks later their daily case growth rate was 10%. Ours today is less than 1%.

"Seeing people in masks in public will bring panic and fear. The country has already demonstrated how irrational fear can lead to things like panic buying toilet paper and paracetamol. 

Even though it is true that in Asia people are all using masks to combat the virus if you actually follow the local news in Asia you'd know there is a huge supply and demand problem. The prices of masks are severely inflated and people who are already in financial hardships are going above and beyond to get their hands on many them as possible. 

People who can't get their hands on a mask are forced to wear the same mask for more than a week or wear inappropriate masks that are ineffective in protecting people from coronavirus (you need a proper duck/P2 mask that seals your mouth). It is recommended that duck mask be changed when the become ""moist"" for proper protection- if anyone has ever worn a duck mask it doesn't take long before it becomes moist. So in reality you'd need several changes of masks a day to ensure you are protected. Even if you had enough supply, disposal is a issue. You'd have to have a proper disposal facility to ensure it doesn't cause contamination. 

Masks is likely to foster a false sense of security, which might do more harm than good.

"1. Masks are not nearly as effective as people think. Common sense says they should work but evidence and scientific study reveals that masks only have a slight benefit for sick people. The reason for this is not because masks are bad, but because people can't use them correctly. For masks to be effective you have to be properly trained and experienced in using them (like doctors, although not even they are very good at it).
2. Masks are in short supply. Because they are essentially single-use only it's a waste for healthy people to buy them and wear them. Priority for masks should go to healthcare providers and those dealing with the vulnerable first, sick people second (although it's better for them to just stay isolated at home).
3. Many Asian cultures adopted widespread mask wearing for sick people decades ago, after their multiple experiences with similar viral epidemics.

Had to pick up a parcel from the local post office the other day - had to sign for it using the Aus Post electronic reader/pen device - told them I would prefer not to touch the pen given it had already been touched by hundreds (probably) that day - the person behind the counter looked at me like I was clearly nuts.  Hygiene is absolutely critical at the moment - not sure why it's so hard for people to understand that - common sense I suppose it's not as common as it should be.,9.0,2020-03-18 00:48:38,498.0

"I'm worried that if our business has to close, how we will arrange post redirection to our homes.
