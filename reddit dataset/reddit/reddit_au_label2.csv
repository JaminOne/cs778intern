113,exactly gov dont want panic know community spread going like wildfire pretend dont know tell reporter areare allowed question total lack community testing maintain plausible deniability inevitable occurs 60 infected le 2 month fact thing would slow anyway everyone infected staying home measure would either way figure might aswell keep panic minimum talk aspect,negative,negative
114,many way testing measure pattern human activity death toll better measure virus activity problem 173 day average time infection death best probably decide mortality rate want use model example said 05 18 death 3600 case 17 day ago use whatever doubling rate think right estimate infection count today example double every 4 day would 60000 infection australia today course decide doubling rate comfortable fairly reflect impact intervention around isolation cancelled event etc lot assumption make hard good modelling,negative,negative
115,agree came post positive test rate shouldnt falling least two week based understand incubation asymptomatic spread going cause wave symptomatic infection guess 10 day reality going catch bite hard,positive,positive
116,also worth noting every country testing lacking seeing people extrapolating death rate factor 60000 total true case number cant compare place 60000 reported case assumption heap untested unreported case true everywhere else chance country also 20x 50x true case compared reported number relative bad thing elsewhere much better yes safe estimate treat outbreak 1050x worse number mean still much better placed country believe well see big spike case next two week still unchecked community spread sort beyond point cant wont test everyone symptom thats fine wont give u much extra information treating everyone infected see land week start nailing infection spread mapping minimise new infection itll process main thing let early there indication thats plan,positive,positive
117,one caveat whole post idea day test number higher contact tracing test may done people slight risk much higher likelihood returning negative people tested example testing everyone attended particular wedding one guest tested positive boost number test majority people test negative lower daily percentage positive case day test number low likely people high risk tested rising percentage positive test despite think point still stand new case arent decreasing like seems like,positive,negative
